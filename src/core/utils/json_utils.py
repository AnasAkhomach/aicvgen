"""JSON parsing utilities for LLM responses.

This module provides centralized JSON parsing functionality.
Note: Legacy manual JSON parsing functions have been removed in favor
of structured output generation using Pydantic models.
"""

# This module is kept for potential future JSON utility functions
# All agents now use structured output via generate_structured_content()
