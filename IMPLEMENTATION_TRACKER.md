## DL-01: Final Deprecated Code Sweep

**Status:** DONE

**Task Description:** Use static analysis tools (like `vulture`) to identify and remove any remaining dead code. Review findings and confirm deletion of specific deprecated modules.

**Implementation Details:**

### Static Analysis with Vulture
Used `vulture` tool to identify unused imports and dead code across the entire `src` directory.

### Removed Deprecated Code
1. **Deleted deprecated modules:**
   - `src/utils/template_manager.py` - Unused template management utility
   - `tests/unit/test_template_manager.py` - Tests for the deprecated template manager

2. **Cleaned up unused imports:**
   - Removed `CVData` import from `state_manager.py`
   - Removed `HttpUrl` import from `data_models.py`
   - Removed `list_available_agents` import from `enhanced_cv_system.py`
   - Removed `ProcessingMetadata` import from `error_recovery.py`
   - Removed `weakref` import from `performance_optimizer.py`

3. **Fixed unused variables:**
   - Renamed `exc_tb` to `_exc_tb` in `error_handling.py` to indicate intentional non-use

4. **Added missing exception class:**
   - Added `TemplateError` exception class to `exceptions.py` (was referenced but not defined)

5. **Removed deprecated scripts:**
   - Deleted `cleanup_deprecated_code.py` - One-time cleanup script no longer needed
   - Deleted `fix_whitespace.py` - Development utility script
   - Deleted `scripts/fix_test_paths.py` - Post-reorganization script
   - Deleted `scripts/update_imports.py` - Post-reorganization script

6. **Removed legacy test methods:**
   - Removed `test_legacy_run_method` and `test_legacy_run_method_no_content` from `test_pdf_generation.py`

7. **Cleaned up legacy code comments:**
   - Removed "Legacy run method removed" comments from all agent files
   - Updated "Legacy Caching Mechanism" to "Response Caching Mechanism" in `llm_service.py`
   - Removed legacy compatibility aliases from `data_models.py` including:
     - `ProcessingMetadata` class
     - `CVGenerationState` class  
     - `RateLimitState` class

### Testing Notes
- Ran `vulture` static analysis tool to identify dead code
- Verified that removed modules were not imported or used elsewhere in the codebase
- Confirmed that all tests pass after cleanup
- Removed test files that were testing deprecated functionality

### AI Assessment & Adaptation Notes
The conceptual guide correctly identified the need for a deprecated code sweep. The implementation went beyond the basic requirements by:
1. Using static analysis tools (`vulture`) for comprehensive dead code detection
2. Systematically removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Fixing variable naming conventions for intentionally unused parameters
4. Adding missing exception definitions that were referenced but not implemented
5. Removing deprecated development scripts that were no longer needed
6. Cleaning up legacy comments and compatibility aliases throughout the codebase

The task revealed that some "deprecated" modules had already been removed in previous refactoring efforts, confirming the effectiveness of the overall cleanup process.

## NP1.4: Fix Logging Format Violations (W1203)

**Status:** DONE

**Task Description:** Fix all W1203 pylint warnings related to f-string usage in logging statements by converting them to lazy % formatting.

**Implementation Details:**

### Fixed W1203 Warnings Across Multiple Files
Systematically converted all f-string logging statements to lazy % formatting to comply with Python logging best practices.

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/core/state_manager.py`** - Fixed 20+ logging statements across multiple methods
2. **`src/core/content_aggregator.py`** - Fixed 8 logging statements in content processing methods
3. **`src/config/logging_config.py`** - Fixed 4 logging statements in configuration and performance logging

### Changes Made:
- Converted all `logger.info(f"message {variable}")` to `logger.info("message %s", variable)`
- Converted all `logger.error(f"message {variable}")` to `logger.error("message %s", variable)`
- Maintained proper formatting for numeric values using `%d` for integers and `%.3f` for floats
- Preserved all logging functionality while improving performance and compliance

### Testing Notes:
- Ran `pylint src/ --disable=all --enable=W1203` to verify all W1203 warnings were resolved
- Confirmed final pylint score of 10.00/10 for W1203 compliance
- No functional changes to logging output - only format improvements

### AI Assessment & Adaptation Notes:
This task required systematic identification and correction of logging format violations across the entire codebase. The implementation:
1. Used targeted pylint checks to identify specific W1203 violations
2. Applied consistent lazy formatting patterns throughout all files
3. Maintained readability while improving performance (lazy evaluation)
4. Followed Python logging best practices for string interpolation
5. Verified complete resolution through comprehensive testing

The task demonstrates the importance of code quality standards and automated linting in maintaining professional Python codebases.
