# CHANGELOG

## Sprint: Finalize UI Consolidation and Streaming Integration

### FUI-P1-01: Consolidate All UI Rendering Logic into a Single UIManager
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**: All UI rendering logic has been consolidated into `src/frontend/ui_manager.py`. The old workflow controller has been removed and app.py now uses the unified UIManager.
**Tests**: Existing tests updated and passing.
**Notes**: Successfully merged all UI components into a single cohesive manager.

### FUI-P1-02: Finalize Structural Consolidation by Deleting Obsolete UI Directory
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**: The `src/ui` directory has been removed and all imports updated to use `src.frontend.ui_manager`.
**Tests**: All tests passing after import updates.
**Notes**: Clean structural consolidation achieved.

### FUI-P2-01: Refactor Backend to Expose a Streaming Workflow Endpoint
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**: Added `astream_workflow` method to WorkflowManager and `stream_cv_generation` method to CvGenerationFacade. Both methods properly handle streaming with callbacks.
**Tests**: Backend streaming functionality tested and working.
**Notes**: Backend now supports streaming workflows with proper callback integration.

### FUI-P2-02: Integrate StreamlitCallbackHandler into the Consolidated UI
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**:
- Updated `src/frontend/callbacks.py` to use streaming with `StreamlitCallbackHandler`
- Removed old polling logic and replaced with async streaming
- Added proper error handling and status updates
- Updated `src/frontend/ui_manager.py` to support callback handlers in streaming
**Tests**: Created comprehensive tests in `tests/unit/frontend/test_callbacks_streaming.py` covering:
- Successful streaming CV generation
- Streaming failure scenarios
- Proper StreamlitCallbackHandler instantiation
**Notes**: Successfully replaced polling mechanism with event-driven streaming UI. All tests passing.

## Sprint: Consolidate Application Initialization Logic

### REM-FIN-01: Consolidate All Application Initialization Logic into ApplicationStartupService
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**: Enhanced `src/core/application_startup.py` to become the single source of truth for all initialization:
- Added logging setup via `setup_logging()`
- Added StateManager initialization and management
- Consolidated DI container setup and API key validation
- Added `get_state_manager()` method for centralized access
- Integrated atexit shutdown hook registration
**Tests**: All existing tests pass (424 passed, 1 skipped)
**Notes**: ApplicationStartupService now handles all initialization tasks previously scattered across app.py and main.py.

### REM-FIN-02: Refactor app.py to Use the Centralized Startup Service
**Status**: Completed ✅

### REM-FIX-01: Modernize UserCVParserAgent to Align with New Architecture
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**:
- Refactored UserCVParserAgent to use LLMCVParserService instead of direct LLM service calls
- Updated constructor to only require llm_cv_parser_service dependency
- Simplified run() method to delegate parsing to the specialized service
- Updated AgentFactory to use new constructor signature
- Integrated UserCVParserAgent into CvGenerationFacade with proper DI injection
- Modified start_cv_generation to parse CV first before creating workflow
**Tests**: Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/agents/test_user_cv_parser_agent.py` covering:
- Agent initialization and dependency injection
- CV parsing with valid and invalid inputs
- Error handling for empty/whitespace CV text
- Progress tracking during execution
- Legacy _execute method compatibility
**Notes**: UserCVParserAgent now follows the Single Responsibility Principle and integrates seamlessly with the modernized architecture. All 8 tests passing.

### REM-FIX-02: Integrate UserCVParserAgent into the CvGenerationFacade
**Status**: Completed ✅

## Bug Fixes

### CB-010: Fix WorkflowManager END State Handling
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**: Fixed WorkflowManager incorrectly treating the "END" state as an error instead of normal workflow completion:
- Updated `trigger_workflow_step` method to check if exception message is "END" and handle it as successful completion
- Updated `astream_workflow` method to differentiate between "END" state and actual errors during streaming
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated `route_from_supervisor` in `src/orchestration/nodes/routing_nodes.py` to return the LangGraph `END` constant instead of string "END" when routing to completion
- When "END" is encountered, workflow status is set to "COMPLETED" and state is saved properly
- Actual errors continue to be handled as before with proper error logging and callback notifications
**Tests**: Verified with comprehensive testing:
- END state routing returns correct LangGraph END constant
- Regular routing continues to work for other workflow nodes
- Application runs without BlockingIOError or END state exceptions
**Notes**: This completely resolves the BlockingIOError and "END" state exceptions that were occurring when workflows completed successfully. The root cause was the routing function returning a string instead of the LangGraph END constant required by conditional edges.
**Implementation**: Completely refactored `app.py` to delegate all initialization to ApplicationStartupService:
- Removed direct calls to `setup_logging()` and `StateManager()`
- Added proper error handling for ConfigurationError and ServiceInitializationError
- Integrated with centralized startup service via `get_startup_manager()`
- Maintained all existing functionality while eliminating code duplication
**Tests**: Application runs successfully on Streamlit with no errors
**Notes**: app.py is now a clean entry point that delegates to the centralized service.

### REM-FIN-03: Deprecate and Delete the Redundant main.py Entry Point
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**: Successfully removed `src/core/main.py` from the codebase:
- Physically deleted the redundant main.py file
- Verified all tests pass after deletion (424 passed, 1 skipped)
- Confirmed application stability without the legacy entry point
**Tests**: Full test suite passes, application runs successfully
**Notes**: Legacy main.py entry point successfully removed with no impact on functionality.

## Sprint: Workflow Architecture Improvements

### WF-ARCH-01: Move CV Parsing Logic from CvGenerationFacade to Workflow Node
**Status**: Completed ✅
**Implementation**:
- Added `user_cv_parser_node` to `src/orchestration/nodes/parsing_nodes.py`
- Updated main workflow graph to include `USER_CV_PARSER` node as the first step after entry router
- Modified routing logic to start workflow from `USER_CV_PARSER` instead of `JD_PARSER`
- Simplified `CvGenerationFacade.start_cv_generation()` by removing direct CV parsing logic
- Updated workflow edges: `ENTRY_ROUTER` → `USER_CV_PARSER` → `JD_PARSER`
**Tests**:
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/test_user_cv_parser_node.py`
- Updated workflow graph tests to include new node
- All tests passing (6 passed for new node tests)
**Notes**: CV parsing is now properly handled within the workflow architecture, improving separation of concerns and making the workflow more consistent.

## Summary
All tasks from both sprints have been completed successfully. The application now features:
- Consolidated UI management in a single UIManager
- Clean project structure with obsolete directories removed
- Streaming backend with proper callback support
- Modern event-driven UI with real-time updates
- Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- **Centralized application initialization in ApplicationStartupService**
- **Single, clean entry point (app.py) with proper error handling**
- **Eliminated redundant initialization code and legacy entry points**
- **Improved workflow architecture with CV parsing as a dedicated node**
