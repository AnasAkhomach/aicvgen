# CHANGELOG - AI CV Generator Refactoring & Remediation

## Implementation Status

### Priority 1 (P1) Tasks - Critical Fixes

#### Task S-01: Fortify LLM JSON Parsing Service

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Fix unsafe json.loads() in llm_cv_parser_service.py that causes JSONDecodeError crashes
- **Implementation**: Refactored `_generate_and_parse_json` in `llm_cv_parser_service.py` to robustly extract and parse JSON from LLM responses, handle markdown code fences, validate input, and raise `LLMResponseParsingError` on failure. Added comprehensive logging. Logic ensures malformed JSON triggers the correct error for testability.
- **Tests**: Added `tests/unit/test_llm_cv_parser_service.py` with cases for valid JSON, markdown-wrapped JSON, empty string, malformed JSON, and no JSON present. All tests pass.
- **Notes**: Adjusted import paths to absolute for compatibility with pytest. Ensured error messages are consistent for testability.

#### Task S-02: Fix Asynchronous Call Contract in EnhancedLLMService

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Fix synchronous method incorrectly calling async method without await
- **Implementation**: Refactored `EnhancedLLMService` to remove ThreadPoolExecutor and sync wrappers. All LLM calls now use async/await and `asyncio.wait_for` for timeout. Removed `_generate_with_timeout` and `_make_llm_api_call`.
- **Tests**: Added `tests/unit/test_llm_service.py` to verify async contract and timeout handling. All tests pass.
- **Notes**: Ensured all code paths are fully async and production-safe. Mocked LLM responses in tests to match expected structure.

#### Task O-01: Implement Workflow Resilience to Node Failures

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Restore and harden the anasakhomach-aicvgen CV workflow to comply with TASK_BLUEPRINT.md, eliminate technical debt, and ensure all unit and integration tests (especially the CV workflow error handling integration test) pass.
- **Implementation**:
  - Restored the full LangGraph workflow logic (`parser` → `research` → `generate_skills` → `setup_generation_queue` → `pop_next_item` → `content_writer` → `qa` → `error_handler`/`formatter`).
  - Fixed a Pydantic validation error in `ResearchAgentOutput` by updating the model to accept `ResearchFindings` and adding a custom validator.
  - Corrected a bug in `ResearchAgent` where UUIDs were not converted to strings for vector store metadata, causing retrieval failures.
  - Added missing node methods (`generate_skills_node`, `setup_generation_queue_node`, `pop_next_item_node`) to `cv_workflow_graph.py` to complete the business logic.
  - Refactored the `error_handler` node to clear all errors from the state and apply recovery strategies, ensuring the workflow can recover gracefully.
  - Normalized section name matching in `generate_skills_node` to handle variations in section titles.
- **Tests**:
  - Reworked integration tests in `tests/integration/test_cv_workflow_error_handling.py` to remove complex mocking and event loop issues.
  - The tests now reliably simulate node failures and verify that the `error_handler` node is triggered correctly and that its recovery logic functions as expected.
  - Both error handling regression tests now pass consistently.
- **Notes**: The CV workflow is now architecturally sound, robust against common failures, and routes errors as intended by `TASK_BLUEPRINT.md`. The integration tests provide strong guarantees about workflow resilience.

### Priority 2 (P2) Tasks - Architecture & Models

#### Task M-01: Consolidate Agent-Specific Output Models

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Create central agent_output_models.py to eliminate DRY violations
- **Implementation**: Created `src/models/agent_output_models.py` with canonical output models for all agents. Deprecated agent-specific output models in their respective files and added comments for removal. All agents should now use the canonical models for output.
- **Tests**: Existing and new agent tests pass using the canonical output models. No regressions observed in unit or integration tests.
- **Notes**: This change enforces strict data contracts and reduces model duplication. Deprecated models are marked for removal after migration is complete.

#### Task DI-01: Centralize Dependency Injection Container

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Fix multiple container instantiation undermining singleton pattern and centralize dependency registration.
- **Implementation**:
  - Refactored `src/core/dependency_injection.py` to implement a thread-safe singleton `AppContainer` using a lock.
  - Centralized all dependency registration and configuration into `src/core/application_startup.py`.
  - Registered `QualityAssuranceAgent` and `ErrorRecoveryService` in the container, ensuring correct logger injection for the `ErrorRecoveryService`.
  - Updated all components that previously instantiated their own dependencies to retrieve them from the central container.
- **Tests**:
  - Rewrote `tests/unit/test_dependency_injection.py` to test the singleton implementation and centralized configuration.
  - Verified through integration tests (`test_cv_workflow_error_handling.py`) that agents (`ParserAgent`, `QualityAssuranceAgent`) receive their dependencies correctly from the container.
- **Notes**: The new implementation ensures a single, consistent container instance across the application, resolving previous circular import and state management issues. This completes the DI refactoring task.

#### Task U-01: Consolidate Error Handling Framework

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Merge 6 different error handling modules into canonical structure.
- **Implementation**:
  - Created a new `src/error_handling` package to serve as the single source of truth for all error-related logic.
  - Migrated logic from `src/utils/error_handling.py` to `src/error_handling/models.py`.
  - Migrated logic from `src/utils/error_classification.py` to `src/error_handling/classification.py`.
  - Migrated logic from `src/utils/error_utils.py` to `src/error_handling/decorators.py`.
  - Migrated logic from `src/utils/agent_error_handling.py` to `src/error_handling/agent_error_handler.py`.
  - Migrated logic from `src/utils/error_boundaries.py` to `src/error_handling/boundaries.py`.
  - Updated all imports across the application to point to the new `src/error_handling` package.
- **Tests**:
  - All existing unit and integration tests pass, confirming that the refactoring did not introduce regressions.
  - The new structure makes it easier to test error handling logic in isolation.
- **Notes**: This consolidation removes duplicated code, clarifies the error handling strategy, and improves maintainability. The old files in `src/utils` (`error_utils.py`, `error_handling.py`, `error_classification.py`, `error_boundaries.py`, `agent_error_handling.py`) are now redundant and should be deleted.

### Priority 3 (P3) Tasks - Code Hygiene

#### Task C-01: Unify Linter Configuration and Remove Orphaned Files

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Remove conflicting pylintrc files and orphaned/backup files
- **Implementation**:
  - **DONE:** Deleted redundant `config/.pylintrc` to establish a single source of truth for linting.
  - **DONE:** Removed orphaned files (`emergency_fix.py`, `userinput.py`, `src/core/dependency_injection.py.backup`) to improve code hygiene.
  - **DONE:** Verified the root `.pylintrc` is configured for `py-version=3.11`.
- **Tests**:
- **Notes**:

#### Task A-01: Refactor create_empty_cv_structure out of ParserAgent

- **Status**: DONE
- **Description**: Move factory logic from ParserAgent to StructuredCV model as static method
- **Implementation**: Moved the logic for creating an empty CV structure from `ParserAgent` to a new class method `StructuredCV.create_empty()` in `src/models/data_models.py`. The `ParserAgent` now calls this method when it needs to create a fallback CV structure, cleaning up its responsibilities.
- **Tests**: Added `tests/unit/test_data_models.py` to verify the behavior of `StructuredCV.create_empty()`. Updated `tests/unit/test_parser_agent.py` to reflect the change in the agent's behavior. All tests pass.
- **Notes**: This refactoring improves model cohesion and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Implementation Notes

### Architectural Principles Being Enforced:
- **Fail-fast & Recover Gracefully**: Detect and handle errors at the point of failure
- **Single Source of Truth**: Unify configuration, data models, and utility functions
- **Strict Contracts**: Enforce data contracts between components using Pydantic models
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Isolate business logic (agents), orchestration (LangGraph), and services
- **Asynchronous Best Practices**: Eliminate blocking I/O in asynchronous contexts

### State Management Architecture Validated:
1. **UI State (st.session_state)**: Raw user inputs and simple UI flags
2. **Workflow State (AgentState)**: Canonical Pydantic model as single source of truth
3. **State Initialization**: create_initial_agent_state factory for AgentState creation
4. **Data Flow**: UI → AgentState → Background Thread → LangGraph → Updated AgentState → UI
