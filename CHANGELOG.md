- **Notes:**
  - Cleanup of temporary file created during refactoring that was never removed
  - No functional changes - just removing code duplication

## Task P0-DATA-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION (P0): Consolidate Multiple Competing CV Data Models

- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - **Phase 1: Removed Unused CVData Model**
    - Deleted `CVData` class definition from `src/models/data_models.py` (was completely unused)
    - Confirmed no imports or references to `CVData` existed in the codebase
  - **Phase 2: Migrated ContentAggregator from ContentData to StructuredCV**
    - Completely refactored `src/core/content_aggregator.py` to work directly with StructuredCV
    - Updated `aggregate_results()` method to return StructuredCV instead of dictionary
    - Replaced dictionary-based content mapping with StructuredCV Section/Item structure
    - Improved content type inference logic with more specific keyword matching
    - Updated Big 10 skills population to work with StructuredCV structure
    - Added helper methods: `_add_content_to_section()`, `_find_or_create_section()`
  - **Phase 3: Removed ContentData Model and Conversion Methods**
    - Deleted `ContentData` class definition from `src/models/data_models.py`
    - Removed `StructuredCV.to_content_data()` conversion method
    - Removed `StructuredCV.update_from_content()` conversion method
    - Fixed `StructuredCV.create_empty()` parameter order for consistency
- **Tests:**
  - Created `tests/unit/test_content_aggregator_refactored.py` with 19 comprehensive tests
  - Created `tests/integration/test_structured_cv_state_integration.py` with 11 integration tests
  - All tests pass, validating:
    - ContentAggregator works correctly with StructuredCV
    - StructuredCV serialization/deserialization
    - AgentState integration with StructuredCV
    - Complete state persistence cycle integrity
    - Data consistency across operations
- **Notes:**
  - This was a **P0 critical architectural issue** that has been resolved
  - **Single canonical data model**: StructuredCV is now the sole CV data model
  - **Eliminated data conversion overhead**: No more conversion between competing models
  - **Improved data consistency**: All CV operations use the same data structure
  - **Reduced maintenance complexity**: Single model to maintain and extend
  - No breaking changes to existing StructuredCV usage patterns

## Task P0-DI-CONSOLIDATION (P0): Consolidate Dual Dependency Injection Systems

- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - **Phase 1: Consolidated DI Container**
    - Enhanced `src/core/container.py` to be the single source of truth for dependency injection
    - Added thread-safe singleton `get_container()` function with proper locking
    - Standardized on `dependency-injector` library for all dependency management
  - **Phase 2: Removed Redundant System**
    - Deleted `src/core/dependency_injection.py` (custom DI implementation)

  - Added `validate_di_refactoring.py` script that confirms:
    - Container singleton behavior works correctly
    - Services can be instantiated through container
    - Thread-safe access is maintained
- **Notes:**
  - This was a **P0 critical architectural issue** that has been resolved
  - The application now uses a single, standardized DI system
  - Eliminates unpredictable dependency resolution and maintenance overhead
  - Agent providers temporarily commented out in container due to import issues (separate task)
  - All core services (config, LLM service, vector store) are working correctly

## Task A1-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE (P1): Agent Architecture Standardization and Refactoring

- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - **Phase 1: Standardized Base Classes**
    - Ensured all agents properly inherit from `AgentBase`
    - Standardized `run` method signature: `async def run(self, **kwargs: Any) -> AgentResult`
    - Fixed constructor signatures to match base class requirements with proper `session_id` parameter
  - **Phase 2: Fixed Import Statements**
    - Added missing imports for `AgentResult`, `AgentExecutionContext`, and `Any` across all agents
    - Fixed incorrect import paths (e.g., `src.models.agent_models` → `..models.agent_models`)
    - Removed unused imports to clean up the codebase
  - **Phase 3: Resolved Missing Classes and Methods**
    - Fixed missing `@classmethod` decorator on `AgentResult.success()` method
    - Updated agent run methods to use `**kwargs` parameter extraction with proper validation
    - Standardized error handling patterns using `AgentResult.failure()` instead of non-existent methods
  - **Phase 4: Fixed Logging and Core Issues**
    - Fixed `StructuredLogger` usage across all agents (f-string formatting instead of % formatting)
    - Updated `AgentBase` to use proper logging interface
    - Ensured all agents follow consistent error handling and result patterns
  - **Phase 5: Restored Agent Providers**
    - Uncommented and fixed agent imports in `src/core/container.py`
    - Updated agent provider configurations with correct parameters
    - Simplified configuration to use empty dictionaries for missing settings
  - **Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing**
    - Created `tests/unit/test_agent_architecture.py` with full coverage of agent base functionality
    - Verified AgentResult creation, AgentExecutionContext usage, and agent execution patterns
    - All tests pass successfully, confirming architecture consistency
  - **Phase 7: Fixed DI Container Issues**
    - Fixed configuration path issue in container (`config.provided.paths.prompts` → `config.provided.prompts_directory`)
    - Added missing `session_id` parameters to CleaningAgent and QualityAssuranceAgent constructors
    - Fixed FormatterAgent provider configuration (removed unnecessary llm_service dependency)
    - Added missing `vector_store_service` to ResearchAgent provider configuration
    - **Result: All 7 agents now successfully instantiate through the DI container**
- **Tests:** Unit tests created and passing for agent architecture consistency
- **Notes:** All 7 agents (CVAnalyzer, Formatter, EnhancedContentWriter, Research, Parser, Cleaning, QualityAssurance) now follow standardized patterns and can be instantiated through the DI container

## Task API-KEY-VALIDATION-FIX: Fix API Key Validation Crash in Streamlit App

- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅
- **Implementation:**
  - **Problem 1: Missing LLMClient Methods**
    - Fixed `AttributeError: 'LLMClient' object has no attribute 'list_models'`
    - Added `async def list_models()` method to `LLMClient` class using `genai.list_models()`
    - Added `def reconfigure(api_key: str)` method to `LLMClient` class using `genai.configure()`
    - Updated imports to include `List` type hint
  - **Problem 2: Dependency Injection API Key Configuration Issue**
    - Fixed `TypeError: Expected str, not <class 'dependency_injector.providers.AttributeGetter'>`
    - Removed premature `genai.configure()` call from container initialization
    - Created `create_configured_llm_model()` factory function that properly configures API key before model creation
    - Updated container to use factory function for LLM model creation with proper API key resolution
  - **Problem 3: Syntax Error in CVWorkflowGraph**
    - Fixed incorrect decorator placement in `cv_analyzer_node` method
    - Moved `@validate_node_output` decorator to proper position before method definition
- **Tests:**
  - Verified container can be imported and instantiated without errors
  - Confirmed LLM model creation works with proper API key configuration
  - Tested LLM service creation and API key validation functionality
  - Verified Streamlit app starts and responds without critical errors (Status: 200)
  - Confirmed API key validation no longer crashes the application
- **Notes:**
  - The core issue was that dependency injection providers were being passed directly to Google's API instead of resolved values
  - The factory function pattern ensures API key is properly resolved before being used for authentication
  - Streamlit watchdog threading warnings remain (known Streamlit issue on Windows) but don't affect functionality
  - All critical functionality now works correctly without application crashes
