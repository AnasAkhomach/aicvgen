## Now, I'm developing content about work roles (hereafter, "the Roles") that I've included in a resume I'm writing (hereafter, "the Resume").

**Goal:** Generate tailored CV content for MULTIPLE professional roles in one go.

**Input:** You will receive a LIST of Roles. For EACH Role, you'll find role metadata and key outcomes between `<role_info_start>` and `<role_info_end>` tags, and within these, `<info>` and `<accomplishments>` tags. You'll also receive the target resume skills between `<skills>` tags (these skills are the same for all roles in this batch).

**What to Do for EACH Role:**
1. Create a concise **Organization Description** (<200 characters)
2. Create a clear **Role Description** (<200 characters)
3. For each skill in `<skills>`, do:
    - Analyze alignment with accomplishments (1–5)
    - Write a strong bullet point if aligned
    - Skip or flag if not applicable

**Formatting:**
- Use the format below for EACH ROLE. Stick to plain text Markdown.
- Don't make up data.
- No prefaces, no summaries.
- Avoid repetition across bullet points within EACH role.
- Clearly separate output for each role using role titles and organization names as headers.

### Suggested Resume Bullet Point for {{Skill}} (Alignment Score: {{Score}})
*{{Skill}}*: {{bullet}}


## Example Role Descriptions (Keep one as example)
Below, you'll find examples of well-written role descriptions (hereafter, "Role Description Examples").

• "Led a team on a $40mm SAP implementation for Avenet’s operations in North America and the EMEA region."

## Example Organization Descriptions (Keep one as example)
Below, you'll find examples of well-written organization descriptions (hereafter, "Organization Description Examples") in the Eazl resume format.

• "One of Western Europe’s largest providers of IT solutions, machinery, products, logistics, and support to supermarkets, food manufacturers, restaurants, and food wholesalers with ~45 full-time staff."

• *Invoicing for Clinical Trials*: Manages disbursement of study payments and fees (for patients, sites, and Institutional Review Boards) and performs regular study budget audits. E.g. successfully managed a remote oncology study for Bristol Myers Squibb (November 2019 - February 2020) with a $300k budget.


## Instructions for EACH ROLE:

### Organization Description
Here, consider the Role Information and any of your training data associated with the Organization and/or Industry and generate a description of the Organization that I can use on my resume. Make this description:
• less than 200 characters
• similar in tone and format to what you see in the Organization Description Examples
• clear, concise, and action-oriented

### Role Description
Here, consider the Role Information--particularly the Description, the Accomplishments, and the number of people on your team and generate a general description of the Role that I can use on my resume. Make this description:
• less than 90 characters
• similar in tone and format to what you see in the Role Description Examples
• clear, concise, and action-oriented

### Suggested Bulletpoints
Here, review the Target Skills (provided above in `<skills>`). For each individual skill (hereafter, "the Skill"), review the Accomplishments for the CURRENT ROLE and:
1. Generate an alignment score (hereafter, the "Score") between 1 - 5 with 5 representing close alignment between the Skill and information in the Accomplishments and 1 representing that no relevant accomplishments were identified.
2. Generate a suggested resume bullet point (hereafter, collectively "the Suggested Bulletpoints" and individually the "Suggested Bulletpoint") that highlights information found in the Accomplishments with the Skill. Make this suggested bullet point that's less than 300 characters and is similar in tone and format to what you see in the Bulletpoint Examples, including the bold structure of the Skill followed by the content you generate (like this: *the Skill*: the Suggested Bulletpoint).

Now, sort the Suggested Bulletpoints for the CURRENT ROLE in order of their respective Score and output them (from those with the highest Scores first to those with the lowest last) with your output structured like this:

#### Suggested Resume Bullet Point for {{the Skill}} (Alignment Score: {{the Score}})
