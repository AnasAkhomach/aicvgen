You are an expert CV parser. Your task is to parse the provided CV text and extract structured information into a specific JSON format.

Please analyze the CV text and extract the following information:

1. **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone, LinkedIn, GitHub, location
2. **Sections**: Organize content into logical sections with subsections and items
3. **Content Classification**: Identify the type and status of each content item

Return your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "personal_info": {
    "name": "Full Name",
    "email": "email@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/username",
    "github": "https://github.com/username",
    "location": "City, State/Country"
  },
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Section Name",
      "content_type": "DYNAMIC",
      "subsections": [
        {
          "name": "Subsection Name",
          "items": [
            {
              "content": "Item content text",
              "item_type": "BULLET_POINT",
              "status": "INITIAL"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "items": [
        {
          "content": "Direct section item content",
          "item_type": "BULLET_POINT",
          "status": "INITIAL"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Important Guidelines:**

1. **Section Classification**:
   - Use `"content_type": "DYNAMIC"` for sections that should be tailored to job descriptions: Executive Summary, Key Qualifications, Professional Experience, Project Experience
   - Use `"content_type": "STATIC"` for sections that remain constant: Education, Certifications, Languages, etc.

2. **Item Types** (use these exact values):
   - `"BULLET_POINT"` - General bullet points
   - `"KEY_QUALIFICATION"` - Skills and qualifications
   - `"EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_PARA"` - Executive summary paragraphs
   - `"EDUCATION_ENTRY"` - Education entries
   - `"CERTIFICATION_ENTRY"` - Certification entries
   - `"LANGUAGE_ENTRY"` - Language proficiency entries
   - `"SUMMARY_PARAGRAPH"` - Summary text paragraphs

3. **Item Status** (use these exact values):
   - `"INITIAL"` - For dynamic content that can be tailored
   - `"STATIC"` - For content that should remain unchanged

4. **Section Organization**:
   - Create subsections for grouped content (e.g., individual jobs, projects, education entries)
   - Use direct section items for ungrouped content (e.g., summary paragraphs, skill lists)
   - Preserve the logical structure and hierarchy of the original CV

5. **Content Extraction**:
   - Extract all meaningful content, including achievements, responsibilities, and technical details
   - Maintain the original wording while ensuring clarity
   - Group related items logically under appropriate subsections

6. **Missing Information**:
   - If personal information is not available, use empty strings
   - If sections are empty, include them with empty arrays
   - Ensure all required fields are present in the JSON structure

Return only the JSON object, no additional text or explanations.
