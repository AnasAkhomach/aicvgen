Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project: CV Tailoring AI Agent (MVP)
Version: 1.0
Date: May 1, 2025
Authors: Anas Akhomach


1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the CV Tailoring AI Agent. This system is designed to assist users in tailoring their curriculum vitae (CV) to a specific job description using artificial intelligence (AI) agents. The primary goal is to automate the process of identifying relevant skills and experiences from a user's base CV and rewriting key sections to align with the requirements of a target job advertisement, while allowing the user granular control over the final output.
1.2 Scope
The scope of this MVP focuses on the core functionality required to generate and refine specific sections of a CV based on a main target job description and optionally similar job descriptions. The system will accept a user's base CV (in a supported text format, initially Markdown) and one or more job descriptions as input. It will generate content for the following dynamic CV sections:
Key Qualifications
Professional Experience (tailoring existing roles)
Side Projects (tailoring existing projects)
Executive Summary / Professional Summary
The MVP will include a user interface (UI) that allows the user to review the generated content section by section, and item by item (e.g., individual bullet points), directly edit the text, and provide feedback (accept or request regeneration). The system will maintain the state of the tailoring process and allow for session persistence. The final output will be a tailored CV document in a specified format.
Static sections of the CV (e.g., Education, Certifications, Languages) will be included in the final output but will not be dynamically generated or tailored by the AI within this MVP scope, although they may be used as context for generating dynamic sections (like the Executive Summary).

1.5 Overview
The rest of this document details the overall description of the product, including its perspective, user characteristics, operating environment, and constraints. It then specifies the functional requirements (what the system does) and non-functional requirements (qualities of the system) that the MVP must satisfy.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The CV Tailoring AI Agent is a standalone application with a user interface. It interacts with external services, primarily an LLM API (Groq, as confirmed by code), and potentially an embedding API (though all-MiniLM-L6-v2 suggests a local embedding model could be used). It manages data locally (CV, JD, state persistence, vector database).
2.2 User Classes and Characteristics


The primary users are job seekers who have a base CV and are applying for jobs requiring tailored applications. They likely possess basic computer literacy and the ability to upload files and interact with a web interface. They value efficiency in the application process and desire control over the content representing their professional profile.
2.3 Operating Environment
The system is intended to run in a standard Python environment (as specified by requirements.txt). It requires internet access to communicate with the LLM API. Depending on the chosen output format, a LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live) may be required for PDF compilation. The application will be accessed via a web browser, served by the Streamlit framework.
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
Technology Stack: Must primarily use Python and the libraries specified in requirements.txt (including Streamlit, ChromaDB, Groq, Jinja2).
Architecture: Must adhere to the multi-agent architecture orchestrated by a Manager Agent.
State Management: Must implement granular state management for the StructuredCV at the item level.
User Interface: Must use Streamlit and implement a card-based review system allowing granular feedback.
LLM Dependency: Relies on the availability, performance, and API costs of the chosen LLM (Groq).
Data Handling: User input data (CV, JD) and the tailoring state must be handled locally for the MVP, with secure storage considerations, especially for API keys.
Parsing: Must handle parsing from Markdown (for the base CV template) and plain text (for job descriptions).
Output Format: Must produce the final CV in a consistent format (Markdown or LaTeX/PDF - decision required, prototype suggests LaTeX/PDF).
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Users can provide their CV content in a structured text format (initially Markdown).
Users can provide job description text.
The chosen LLM API (Groq) is accessible and performs adequately for the required generation tasks.
The embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or similar) provides sufficient semantic representation for relevance matching.
For LaTeX/PDF output, the user's environment is capable of running xelatex or an equivalent LaTeX compiler.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project: CV Tailoring AI Agent (MVP)
Version: 1.1 (Revised)
Date: May 1, 2025
Authors: [Your Name/Team Name]


1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the CV Tailoring AI Agent. This system is designed to assist users in tailoring their curriculum vitae (CV) to a specific job description using artificial intelligence (AI) agents. The primary goal is to automate the process of identifying relevant skills and experiences from a user's base CV and rewriting key sections to align with the requirements of a target job advertisement, while allowing the user granular control over the final output.
1.2 Scope
The scope of this MVP focuses on the core functionality required to generate and refine specific sections of a CV based on a main target job description and optionally similar job descriptions. The system will initially accept a user's base CV in structured text format (Markdown), plain text, or allow starting from scratch. It will also accept job descriptions as input text. The system will parse this input into a structured format (ideally JSON) for internal processing. It will generate tailored content for the following dynamic CV sections:
Key Qualifications
Professional Experience (tailoring existing roles)
Side Projects (tailoring existing projects)
Executive Summary / Professional Summary
The MVP will include a user interface (UI) that allows the user to review the generated content section by section, and item by item (e.g., individual bullet points), directly edit the text, and provide feedback (accept or request regeneration). The system will maintain the state of the tailoring process and allow for session persistence. The final output will be a tailored CV document in a specified format.
Static sections of the CV (e.g., Education, Certifications, Languages) will be included in the final output but will not be dynamically generated or tailored by the AI within this MVP scope, although they will be used as context for generating dynamic sections. Future stages may include parsing additional input formats (e.g., image/PDF via OCR) and adding features like web search to gather external information.

1.5 Overview
The rest of this document details the overall description of the product, including its perspective, user characteristics, operating environment, and constraints. It then specifies the functional requirements (what the system does) and non-functional requirements (qualities of the system) that the MVP must satisfy.
2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The CV Tailoring AI Agent is a standalone application with a user interface. It interacts with external services, primarily an LLM API (Google GenAI initially), and utilizes a local vector database (ChromaDB). It manages data locally (CV, JD, state persistence, vector database).
2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
The primary users are job seekers who have a base CV (in various formats or none) and are applying for jobs requiring tailored applications. They likely possess basic computer literacy and the ability to input text or upload files and interact with a web interface. They value efficiency in the application process and desire control over the content representing their professional profile.
2.3 Operating Environment
The system is intended to run in a standard Python environment (as specified by requirements.txt). It requires internet access to communicate with the LLM API (Google GenAI). Depending on the chosen output format, a LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live) may be required for PDF compilation. The MVP application interface will be accessed via a web browser, served by the Streamlit framework, though the intention for production is a more robust backend (e.g., FastAPI) and frontend (e.g., React) architecture.
2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
Technology Stack (MVP): Must primarily use Python and the libraries specified in requirements.txt (including Streamlit for UI, ChromaDB for Vector DB, Google GenAI Python client for LLM, Jinja2 for templating).
Technology Stack (Production Intention): Design should consider a future migration to a more robust architecture, potentially using FastAPI for the backend API and a framework like React for the frontend UI.
Architecture: Must adhere to the multi-agent architecture orchestrated by a Manager Agent.
State Management: Must implement granular state management for the StructuredCV at the item level.
User Interface: Must use Streamlit for the MVP and implement a card-based review system allowing granular feedback.
LLM Dependency: Relies on the availability, performance, and API costs of the chosen LLM (Google GenAI initially; future flexibility for Groq, OpenAI, etc.).
Data Handling: User input data (CV, JD) and the tailoring state must be handled locally for the MVP, with secure storage considerations, especially for API keys.
Parsing: Must handle parsing from Markdown and plain text inputs into a structured JSON format (StructuredCV). The capability to start from scratch will require generating an initial empty StructuredCV structure. Image/PDF parsing (OCR) is a future consideration, not required for MVP.
Vector Database: Must use ChromaDB for the vector database in the MVP, as confirmed by the aicvgen codebase.
Output Format: Must produce the final CV in a consistent format (Markdown or LaTeX/PDF - decision required, prototype suggests LaTeX/PDF).
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Users can provide their CV content in structured text (Markdown), plain text, or have no existing CV to start from scratch. (Parsing image/PDF via OCR is outside MVP scope but planned).
Users can provide job description text.
The chosen LLM API (Google GenAI) is accessible and performs adequately for the required generation tasks.
The embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or similar used with sentence-transformers) provides sufficient semantic representation for relevance matching.
For LaTeX/PDF output, the user's environment is capable of running xelatex or an equivalent LaTeX compiler.
The core AI agent design and interaction patterns are feasible for implementing the required functionality.
