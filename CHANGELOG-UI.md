# CHANGELOG

## FACADE-INIT-FIX: CV Generation Facade Initialization Error Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Problem**:
- Error "CV generation facade not initialized" was occurring in `src.frontend.callbacks`
- UIManager was created without the facade being properly initialized
- The facade was registered in the DI container but never injected into the UIManager

**Implementation**:
- Modified `_get_or_create_ui_manager()` function in `src/frontend/callbacks.py` to retrieve the `CvGenerationFacade` from the DI container
- Added facade initialization call `ui_manager.initialize_facade(facade)` after UIManager creation
- Ensured proper dependency injection flow: Container → Facade → UIManager

**Tests**:
- Created and ran comprehensive test script to verify facade initialization
- Confirmed that UIManager.facade is properly set and has required methods
- Ran existing frontend and facade test suites - all tests passing
- Verified Streamlit application starts without facade initialization errors

**Notes**:
- The UIManager already had the `initialize_facade()` method - it just wasn't being called
- This fix completes the facade pattern integration for the UI layer
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `src/frontend/callbacks.py` - Added facade initialization in `_get_or_create_ui_manager()`

## REM-P2-01: Facade Registration and DI Container Integration

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Successfully verified that `CvGenerationFacade` and its dependencies are correctly registered and retrievable from the DI container
- Fixed multiple logging compatibility issues in `VectorStoreService` where old-style string formatting (`logger.info("message %s", arg)`) was incompatible with the new `StructuredLogger` wrapper
- Updated all logging calls in `vector_store_service.py` to use f-string formatting for compatibility
- Confirmed that basic services (template manager, vector store service, template facade, vector store facade) are properly initialized through the DI container

**Tests**:
- Created and ran `test_facade_registration.py` to verify step-by-step container initialization
- All basic container services now initialize successfully
- Workflow manager circular dependency issue identified but expected (separate concern)

**Notes**:
- The logging compatibility issue was the main blocker preventing proper facade registration
- All `StructuredLogger.info()` calls now use the correct signature (message + kwargs only)
- Container initialization follows proper DI patterns using `get_container()` function

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/vector_store_service.py` - Fixed multiple old-style logging calls
- `test_facade_registration.py` - Created comprehensive container initialization test

## REM-P2-02: GlobalState Field Definitions Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed missing field definitions in `GlobalState` TypedDict that were causing "No entry_route specified" and workflow execution failures
- Added routing control fields: `entry_route`, `next_node`, `last_executed_node` as optional string fields
- Added agent output fields: `parsed_jd`, `research_data`, `cv_analysis` as optional fields
- Updated `create_global_state` function to initialize all new fields with proper default values
- Resolved workflow execution failures where nodes couldn't access required state fields

**Tests**:
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `test_global_state_fields.py` to verify field accessibility
- All 5 tests pass, confirming proper GlobalState field definitions and state creation
- Verified workflow can now execute without missing field errors

**Notes**:
- The root cause was that workflow nodes were trying to access fields not defined in the GlobalState TypedDict
- `entry_router_node` was setting `entry_route` but the field wasn't defined in the state schema
- Similar issues existed for `parsed_jd`, `research_data`, and `cv_analysis` fields used by parsing nodes
- Application now runs successfully without workflow execution failures

**Files Modified**:
- `src/orchestration/state.py` - Added missing fields to GlobalState TypedDict and create_global_state function

## REM-P2-03: Formatter Node Deferral for MVP

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Removed FORMATTER node routing from supervisor_node to align with MVP scope where formatter is deferred to post-MVP
- Updated supervisor_node to route to "END" instead of WorkflowNodes.FORMATTER.value when workflow completion conditions are met
- Fixed inconsistency where main_graph.py had commented out FORMATTER routing but supervisor_node still referenced it
- Updated three routing scenarios in supervisor_node: None current_section_index, completed sections, and section completion logic
- Ensured workflow terminates directly upon completion rather than attempting to route to non-existent formatter node

**Tests**:
- Updated test_supervisor_node_none_handling.py to expect "END" instead of "formatter" for MVP behavior
- All 3 supervisor node tests pass, confirming proper MVP routing logic
- Verified existing supervisor state initialization tests (5 tests) still pass with no regressions
- Total test coverage: 8 passing tests across supervisor functionality

**Notes**:
- The formatter was correctly deferred in main_graph.py but supervisor_node logic wasn't updated to match
- This fix ensures workflow consistency between graph configuration and node routing logic
- MVP now properly terminates workflow without attempting to access deferred formatter functionality
- Post-MVP can re-enable formatter by updating both main_graph.py routing and supervisor_node logic

**Files Modified**:
- `src/orchestration/nodes/workflow_nodes.py` - Updated supervisor_node routing logic to use "END" instead of FORMATTER
- `tests/unit/test_supervisor_node_none_handling.py` - Updated test expectations for MVP behavior

## REM-P2-03: Supervisor Node TypeError and Priority Logic Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `TypeError` in `supervisor_node` when `current_section_index` is `None` during arithmetic operations
- Added explicit `None` check for `current_section_index` before performing comparisons and increments
- Fixed priority logic in `supervisor_node` to handle errors before checking for `None` current_section_index
- Updated logging configuration to filter out application-specific kwargs (`session_id`, `trace_id`, `user_id`) before passing to underlying logger
- Ensured proper error handling flow when no sections with items are found

**Tests**:
- Created comprehensive test suite `test_supervisor_node_none_handling.py` with 3 test scenarios
- All tests pass: None handling, valid index handling, and error priority handling
- Verified existing supervisor state initialization tests still pass (5 tests)
- Confirmed no regressions in workflow routing logic

**Notes**:
- The `_initialize_supervisor_state` function can set `current_section_index` to `None` when no sections contain items
- Previous logic attempted arithmetic operations on `None` values causing `TypeError`
- Error handling now has highest priority, followed by `None` index handling, then normal workflow progression
- Logging fixes prevent `TypeError` from unexpected keyword arguments in structured logging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/orchestration/nodes/workflow_nodes.py` - Added None checks and fixed priority logic in supervisor_node
- `src/config/logging_config.py` - Added _filter_logging_kwargs method to StructuredLogger
- `tests/unit/test_supervisor_node_none_handling.py` - Created comprehensive test coverage

## REM-P2-03: JobDescriptionData Serialization Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed critical serialization issue where `job_description_data` was sometimes stored as string representation instead of proper Pydantic object
- Enhanced `jd_parser_node` to handle both Pydantic objects and string representations gracefully
- Added robust type checking and regex-based extraction for string representations
- Implemented fallback mechanisms to prevent `'str' object has no attribute 'raw_text'` errors
- The fix ensures backward compatibility with existing session files that have corrupted serialization

**Tests**:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_jd_parser_node_serialization_fix.py` with 6 test cases
- Tests cover Pydantic objects, string representations with quotes, without quotes, fallback scenarios, None values, and error handling
- All tests pass, confirming robust handling of different data formats
- Verified application runs successfully without serialization errors

**Notes**:
- Root cause was inconsistent serialization in session files where some had proper `__pydantic_model__` structure while others had string representations
- The fix maintains backward compatibility while preventing runtime errors
- Regex pattern `r"raw_text='([^']*)'|raw_text=([^\s]+)"` extracts raw_text from string representations
- Application now handles legacy session files gracefully without breaking workflows

**Files Modified**:
- `src/orchestration/nodes/parsing_nodes.py` - Enhanced jd_parser_node with robust type handling
- `tests/unit/test_jd_parser_node_serialization_fix.py` - Comprehensive test suite for serialization scenarios

## REM-P2-06: Error Log Fixes - Serialization and Logging Issues

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `'str' object has no attribute 'raw_text'` error in JD Parser node by correcting workflow state serialization in `workflow_manager.py`
- Replaced `json.dump(agent_state, f, indent=2, default=str)` with proper `_serialize_for_json(agent_state)` to maintain Pydantic model structure
- Fixed `Logger._log() got an unexpected keyword argument 'session_id'` error in Error Recovery service by updating logging call format
- Changed `logger.error()` call to include session_id and other context in the message string instead of as keyword arguments

**Tests**:
- Ran existing `test_workflow_manager_serialization_fix.py` - all 4 tests pass, confirming serialization works correctly
- Created `test_error_recovery_logging_fix.py` with 2 tests to verify logging fixes - both tests pass
- Verified that `_record_error` method no longer passes invalid keyword arguments to logger
- Confirmed that `handle_error` integration works without logging errors

**Notes**:
- The serialization issue was caused by `default=str` fallback converting Pydantic models to strings during JSON serialization
- The logging issue was caused by passing `session_id`, `item_id`, etc. as keyword arguments to `logger.error()` which doesn't accept them
- Both fixes maintain existing functionality while resolving the runtime errors
- Error recovery service now properly logs all context information in a formatted message string

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/managers/workflow_manager.py` - Fixed state serialization to use proper `_serialize_for_json` method
- `src/services/error_recovery.py` - Fixed logging call to include context in message string instead of kwargs
- `tests/unit/test_error_recovery_logging_fix.py` - Created comprehensive tests for logging fixes

## REM-P2-07: UUID JSON Serialization Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` error by enhancing `_serialize_for_json` function in `workflow_manager.py`
- Added explicit UUID object handling to convert UUID instances to strings during serialization
- Updated Pydantic model serialization to use `mode='json'` for proper JSON-compatible output
- Resolved serialization errors when `StructuredCV` models with UUID fields (id, section ids, item ids) are processed
- Ensured all UUID objects from `cv_models.py` (Item, ContentItem, Section, StructuredCV) serialize correctly

**Tests**:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_uuid_serialization_fix.py` with 4 tests covering:
  - Direct UUID object serialization
  - StructuredCV with UUID fields serialization
  - Nested structures containing UUIDs
  - Verification that original JSON serialization error is resolved
- All tests pass, confirming UUID serialization works correctly
- Verified end-to-end functionality with manual StructuredCV creation and JSON serialization

**Notes**:
- Root cause was UUID objects from `uuid4()` in `cv_models.py` not being converted to JSON-serializable strings
- The `_serialize_for_json` function now handles UUID objects alongside existing Pydantic model, dict, and list handling
- Fix maintains backward compatibility and doesn't affect existing serialization behavior for other object types
- Critical for workflow state persistence when CV models contain UUID identifiers

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/managers/workflow_manager.py` - Enhanced `_serialize_for_json` to handle UUID objects and improved Pydantic serialization
- `tests/unit/test_uuid_serialization_fix.py` - Created comprehensive UUID serialization test suite

## REM-P2-03: Error Handler Node ContentType Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `error_handler_node` function to properly handle dynamic `ContentType` determination
- Updated the function to use `ContentType.ERROR` as the default content type when error messages are present
- Ensured the node correctly sets the content type based on the presence of errors in the state
- Resolved issues where the error handler was not properly categorizing error states

**Tests**:
- Verified existing tests in `test_error_handler_node_content_type.py` pass successfully
- All 3 tests confirm proper ContentType handling in error scenarios
- Error handler now correctly identifies and processes error states

**Notes**:
- The fix ensures that workflow error handling follows the expected ContentType patterns
- Error states are now properly identified and can be handled by downstream nodes
- No breaking changes to existing error handling logic

**Files Modified**:
- `src/orchestration/utility_nodes.py` - Updated error_handler_node function

## REM-P2-04: Workflow Manager Serialization Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed `WorkflowManager` serialization functions `_serialize_for_json` and `_deserialize_from_json`
- Implemented proper Pydantic model serialization using `__pydantic_model__` markers and `model_dump()`
- Added support for recursive serialization/deserialization of nested objects and collections
- Ensured `JobDescriptionData` and other Pydantic models are correctly preserved during state persistence
- Fixed module import handling in deserialization to properly reconstruct Pydantic model instances

**Tests**:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_workflow_manager_serialization_fix.py`
- All 4 tests pass: serialization, deserialization, round-trip preservation, and workflow integration
- Verified that `JobDescriptionData` objects maintain their structure and data integrity through serialization cycles
- Confirmed proper handling of GlobalState TypedDict structures in serialization

**Notes**:
- The serialization format uses `__pydantic_model__` with full module paths for proper model reconstruction
- Fallback handling ensures graceful degradation if model classes cannot be imported during deserialization
- Solution maintains backward compatibility with existing state files
- Critical for workflow persistence and session management functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/managers/workflow_manager.py` - Enhanced serialization functions
- `tests/unit/test_workflow_manager_serialization_fix.py` - Created comprehensive test suite

## REM-P2-05: Workflow Graph Test MVP Alignment

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Updated `test_cv_workflow_graph.py` to align with MVP implementation that defers certain nodes to post-MVP
- Removed references to `qa_node`, `research_node`, `cv_analyzer_node`, and `formatter_node` from test expectations
- Updated subgraph building tests to only expect `writer_node_func` and `updater_node_func` parameters
- Modified `test_create_node_functions` to verify only MVP-implemented nodes are present and deferred nodes are absent
- Ensured tests match the actual `create_node_functions` implementation in `main_graph.py`

**Tests**:
- All 12 tests in `test_cv_workflow_graph.py` now pass successfully
- Fixed 5 previously failing tests: `test_build_key_qualifications_subgraph`, `test_build_professional_experience_subgraph`, `test_build_projects_subgraph`, `test_build_executive_summary_subgraph`, and `test_create_node_functions`
- Tests now correctly validate MVP workflow graph structure without expecting post-MVP features

**Notes**:
- The tests were expecting nodes that are commented out in the MVP implementation
- MVP focuses on core content generation workflow: parsing, writing, updating, and feedback handling
- QA, research, CV analysis, and formatting nodes are deferred to post-MVP as documented in the codebase
- Test alignment ensures CI/CD pipeline stability for MVP development

**Files Modified**:
- `tests/unit/test_cv_workflow_graph.py` - Updated test expectations to match MVP implementation

## REM-P2-03: Container Dependency Injection Fix

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Fixed critical NoneType error in WorkflowManager where `container.job_description_parser_agent()` was being called with a None container
- Root cause: Container class's custom `__new__` method with singleton_key requirement conflicted with `providers.Self()` in dependency injection
- Replaced `container=providers.Self()` with `container=providers.Callable(lambda: ContainerSingleton.get_instance())` in WorkflowManager registration
- This ensures WorkflowManager receives the actual container singleton instance instead of None
- Application now starts successfully without container-related runtime errors

**Tests**:
- Verified application starts without errors using `python -m streamlit run app.py`
- Confirmed WorkflowManager initialization logs show "WorkflowManager initialized with injected services"
- No more NoneType errors in workflow execution

**Notes**:
- The Container class enforces singleton pattern through custom `__new__` method requiring singleton_key
- `providers.Self()` was incompatible with this custom instantiation mechanism
- Using `providers.Callable()` with lambda properly retrieves the singleton instance
- This fix enables proper dependency injection throughout the workflow system

**Files Modified**:
- `src/core/containers/main_container.py` - Updated WorkflowManager container dependency injection
- `tests/unit/test_global_state_fields.py` - Created comprehensive field validation tests

## REM-P1.5-01: MVP Workflow Scoping - Deferred Agents Removal

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- Successfully removed non-essential agents from the main workflow graph to create a minimal, viable MVP-focused workflow
- Deferred agents: `CleaningAgent`, `CvAnalyzerAgent`, `FormatterAgent`, `QualityAssuranceAgent`, and `ResearchAgent`
- Updated `main_graph.py` to comment out deferred agent imports and node function definitions
- Removed deferred agent nodes from main workflow graph: `RESEARCH`, `CV_ANALYZER`, `FORMATTER`
- Removed `QA` nodes from all subgraphs: key qualifications, professional experience, projects, and executive summary
- Simplified workflow routing: JD_PARSER → INITIALIZE_SUPERVISOR → SUPERVISOR → [subgraphs] → END
- Updated subgraph function calls to remove `qa_node_func` parameters
- Modified supervisor routing to include direct END completion path for MVP

**Tests**:
- Workflow graph structure simplified and aligned with MVP scope
- All deferred agent references properly commented out for future restoration
- Main workflow now follows linear progression without complex agent dependencies

**Notes**:
- This creates a minimal viable workflow focusing on core content generation without advanced features
- Deferred agents can be easily restored post-MVP by uncommenting the marked sections
- Workflow complexity significantly reduced, making debugging and maintenance easier
- MVP workflow: Job Description Parsing → Content Generation (4 subgraphs) → Completion

**Files Modified**:
- `src/orchestration/graphs/main_graph.py` - Removed deferred agents from workflow graph and simplified routing
