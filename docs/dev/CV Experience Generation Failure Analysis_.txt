Analysis and Resolution of AttributeError in CV Experience Generation
1. Executive Summary
This report details the investigation into a critical AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get' occurring within the EnhancedContentWriter agent during the generation of "experience" sections for Curricula Vitae (CVs). The failure, logged on 2025-06-10, leads to a complete breakdown of the CV generation workflow.
The root cause is a data structure misalignment: the EnhancedContentWriter agent, when processing experience content, receives the entire raw CV text as a single string within a list, instead of the expected list of structured dictionary items, where each dictionary represents an individual experience role. This mismatch occurs because the upstream ParserAgent (or the logic preparing workflow input) fails to segment the raw CV's experience section into individual, structured items.
The error is pinpointed to the _format_role_info method (and subsequently its helper _format_single_role) within src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py. These methods attempt dictionary operations (like .get()) on the string value representing the full CV text.
The recommended solution (Option A) involves enhancing the ParserAgent in src/agents/parser_agent.py to correctly parse and structure individual experience roles from the raw CV. This approach addresses the problem at its source, ensuring data integrity throughout the workflow. A contingency plan (Option B) to adapt the EnhancedContentWriterAgent is also discussed but is less ideal due to concerns about separation of concerns.
This report provides a detailed analysis of the error, data flow, code-level fault localization, and a step-by-step plan for implementing the recommended fix and verifying its success. Addressing this issue is crucial for restoring the functionality of job-tailored CV generation for experience sections.
2. Problem Identification and Context
2.1. Error Manifestation and Impact
A recurring failure has been observed in the CV generation system, specifically when processing the "experience" content type. The primary error, as evidenced by system logs, is an AttributeError.
* Error Log (Timestamp: 2025-06-10 00:24:58):
2025-06-10 00:24:58,490 - enhanced_content_writer - ERROR - logging_config.py:86 - Content generation failed | {"session_id": null, "item_id": null, "error": "'str' object has no attribute 'get'", "agent_name": "EnhancedContentWriter"}

This error indicates that a string object was used in a context where a dictionary-like object (supporting the .get() method) was expected. The consequence of this failure is severe: the ContentWriterAgent task (identified as 1fcfcffd-dac0-4ccf-bfd2-b25eccf3a6d6 in related logs) fails. This, in turn, causes subsequent tasks in the CV generation workflow to be skipped, leading to an overall failure of the entire process. Users are unable to generate CVs with tailored experience sections.
2.2. Agent Context and Input Data
The error occurs within the EnhancedContentWriter agent. Log entries provide context for its execution:
   * Agent Execution Start (Timestamp: 2025-06-10 00:24:58):
2025-06-10 00:24:58,487 - agent_enhancedcontentwriter - INFO - logging_config.py:80 - Agent execution started | {"agent_name": "EnhancedContentWriter", "session_id": null, "item_id": null, "content_type": "experience", "retry_count": 0}

Crucially, the input data supplied to the EnhancedContentWriter at the time of the error reveals the nature of the problematic data structure:
      * Input Data Snippet (Timestamp: 2025-06-10 00:24:58):
JSON
{
   "job_description_data": "...",
   "content_item": {
       "type": "experience",
       "data": {
           "roles":,
           "personal_info": {}
       }
   },
   "context": {
       "workflow_type": "job_tailored_cv",
       "content_type": "experience",
       "personal_info": {}
   }
}

The key field here is input_data['content_item']['data']['roles']. This field, intended to hold experience roles, is a list containing a single, very long string. This string appears to be the entire raw text of a CV, starting with "# Nouha KARIM...".
3. Detailed Analysis of the AttributeError
3.1. Understanding the Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
The Python AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get' is unambiguous. It signifies that a variable, which the program expected to be a dictionary (or an object behaving like one, supporting key-based access via the .get() method), was, in fact, a string. Operations like variable.get('some_key') are valid for dictionaries but will fail if variable is a string.
3.2. Analyzing the EnhancedContentWriter Input for "experience"
The provided input data log for the EnhancedContentWriter is central to understanding the failure:
The field input_data['content_item']['data']['roles'] is structured as:
``.
A fundamental mismatch is observed here. The agent, when processing the "experience" section, likely anticipates the roles field to be a list of structured dictionaries. For instance, an expected structure might be ``. Instead, it receives a list containing a single element, and that element is one large string representing the entire CV's raw text.
If the agent's logic iterates through the roles list (e.g., via for role_data in roles:), the variable role_data will, in this case, become this one 'long_string'. If subsequent code then assumes role_data is a dictionary and attempts an operation like role_data.get('some_key'), the AttributeError is triggered. This specific structure directly leads to the error when the agent tries to process what it believes is an individual, structured role item but is actually operating on the entire CV text as a string.
3.3. Code-Level Error Localization in EnhancedContentWriterAgent
The primary file under scrutiny is src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py 1, as this is where the EnhancedContentWriterAgent class is defined.
Primary Method of Interest: _format_role_info
The method _format_role_info within EnhancedContentWriterAgent is specifically designed to format role information for prompts when the content_type is "experience".1 This makes it the most probable location for the error.
Analysis of _format_role_info
Examining the structure of _format_role_info 1:


Python




# Relevant part from src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py
def _format_role_info(self, content_item: Dict[str, Any], generation_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
   #...
   if "data" in content_item and "roles" in content_item["data"]:
       roles = content_item["data"]["roles"] # In our case, roles = ['entire CV string']
       #...
       formatted_roles =
       for role in roles: # Here, 'role' becomes 'entire CV string'
           if isinstance(role, dict):
               # This branch is NOT taken because 'role' is a string.
               role_block = self._format_workflow_role(role, generation_context)
               formatted_roles.append(role_block)
           elif isinstance(role, str):
               # THIS BRANCH IS TAKEN. 'role' is the 'entire CV string'.
               parsed_content = self._parse_cv_text_to_content_item(role, generation_context)
               if isinstance(parsed_content, dict):
                   # This path is taken if _parse_cv_text_to_content_item returns a dictionary.
                   # The error likely occurs inside _format_single_role if 'parsed_content'
                   # is not structured as expected by _format_single_role.
                   role_block = self._format_single_role(parsed_content, generation_context)
                   formatted_roles.append(role_block)
               else:
                   # This path is taken if _parse_cv_text_to_content_item does NOT return a dict.
                   logger.warning(f"Failed to parse CV text to structured content: {str(role)[:100]}...")
                   fallback_role = {"name": "Professional Experience", "items":}
                   role_block = self._format_single_role(fallback_role, generation_context)
                   formatted_roles.append(role_block)
           #...
       return "\n\n".join(formatted_roles)
   #...
   else: # This is the path taken if content_item is a single role (legacy) or section with subsections
       return self._format_single_role(content_item, generation_context)

Pinpointing the Exact Failure Point
         1. The roles variable is assigned ['entire CV string'] from content_item['data']['roles'].
         2. The loop for role in roles: executes once. In this iteration, the role variable becomes the 'entire CV string'.
         3. The condition isinstance(role, str) evaluates to true.
         4. The method self._parse_cv_text_to_content_item(role, generation_context) is called, where role is the full CV text.
         * The _parse_cv_text_to_content_item method (also in src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py 1) attempts to parse this full CV string. It looks for specific role patterns (e.g., "Trainee Data Analyst", "IT trainer"). If it fails to parse the entire CV string into a structured dictionary representing a single role, or if its parsing logic is not robust enough for a full CV document, it might return the input string itself or a malformed dictionary.
         5. Error Propagation:
         * If _parse_cv_text_to_content_item returns the original string (the entire CV text), then parsed_content becomes this string.
         * The subsequent check if isinstance(parsed_content, dict): would fail.
         * The else branch would then be executed:
Python
fallback_role = {"name": "Professional Experience", "items":}
role_block = self._format_single_role(fallback_role, generation_context)
This path would likely not cause the AttributeError directly, but would result in generic, incorrect output.
         * However, the error is occurring. This strongly suggests that _parse_cv_text_to_content_item does return a dictionary (so isinstance(parsed_content, dict) is true), but this dictionary (parsed_content) is not structured as deeply or correctly as the subsequent _format_single_role method expects. Alternatively, _parse_cv_text_to_content_item itself could be returning a string, and a subsequent, unlogged attempt to use it as a dictionary occurs if the control flow is different than immediately apparent.
         * The most direct path to the error: If _parse_cv_text_to_content_item returns the input string (the full CV text) due to a parsing failure or by design for unmatchable patterns. Then, parsed_content is this string. If the code proceeded to call _format_single_role(parsed_content,...) (assuming a logic path where the isinstance(parsed_content, dict) check was different or bypassed, or if _format_single_role was called directly on role earlier), then _format_single_role would be operating on a string.
            6. Examining _format_single_role (from src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py 1):
Python
def _format_single_role(self, role_data: Dict[str, Any], generation_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
   #...
   role_title = role_data.get("name", role_data.get("title", "Unknown Role")) # Potential.get() call
   #...
   accomplishments =
   for item_data in role_data.get("items",): # Potential.get() call
       if isinstance(item_data, dict):
           accomplishments.append(item_data.get("content", "")) # Potential.get() call
       elif isinstance(item_data, str):
           accomplishments.append(item_data)
   #...
If role_data (which would be parsed_content from the calling context in _format_role_info) is a string, the very first line role_data.get("name",...) will translate to 'entire CV string'.get("name",...), directly causing the observed AttributeError. This is the most plausible point of failure given the input data.
The method _parse_cv_text_to_content_item appears designed to parse a text segment representing a single role or a simple list of accomplishments, not an entire CV document. When fed the complete CV string, its pattern matching might extract the first recognized role or create a generic "Professional Experience" block, but it is highly unlikely to return a structure that _format_single_role can correctly process if _parse_cv_text_to_content_item itself returns the raw string on a partial parsing failure.
The code in _format_role_info iterates for role in roles:. This implies an expectation that roles is a list of distinct role items. The fact that roles is ['entire CV string'] indicates a failure in an upstream process to segment the CV into individual role items before populating this list.
4. Data Flow and Misalignment Trace
4.1. Upstream Data Preparation
The input_data for the EnhancedContentWriterAgent is typically assembled by an orchestrator or a data adapter based on the defined workflow. The WorkflowBuilder class in src/orchestration/workflow_definitions.py 1 contains an _adapt_input_data_for_agent method, which in turn calls _adapt_for_content_writer.


Python




# In WorkflowBuilder (src/orchestration/workflow_definitions.py)
def _adapt_for_content_writer(
   self,
   input_data: Dict[str, Any], # This is the overall workflow_input
   content_type: ContentType
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
   personal_info = input_data.get("personal_info", {})
   experience = input_data.get("experience",) # CRUCIAL: 'experience' from workflow_input
   job_description = input_data.get("job_description", {})
   adapted_data = {
       "job_description_data": job_description,
       "content_item": {
           "type": content_type.value,
           "data": {
               "roles": experience, # 'experience' is directly assigned here
               "personal_info": personal_info
           }
       },
       "context": {
           "workflow_type": 'job_tailored_cv', # Example
           "content_type": content_type.value,
           "personal_info": personal_info
       }
   }
   return adapted_data

The experience variable in _adapt_for_content_writer is populated from input_data.get("experience",). This input_data refers to the main input of the entire workflow. If this input_data["experience"] already contains the list ['entire CV string'], the adapter is merely propagating this malformed structure. The origin of the problem lies in how workflow_input["experience"] is populated before this adapter is invoked. This points towards the ParserAgent or the initial data loading and structuring phase of the application.
4.2. Role of ParserAgent
The ParserAgent (defined in src/agents/parser_agent.py 1) is responsible for parsing the raw CV text. Its run method typically calls parse_cv_text, which uses helpers like _parse_cv_with_llm or _parse_cv_with_rules to create a StructuredCV object. The output of ParserAgent.run is a dictionary containing {"job_description_data":..., "structured_cv":...}.
The StructuredCV object is designed to hold Section objects. A Section for "Professional Experience" should ideally contain Subsection objects, each representing an individual role with its associated details and bullet points (Item objects).
It is hypothesized that the ParserAgent is failing to correctly segment the "experience" section of the raw CV into these individual Subsections within the StructuredCV. It might be placing the entire raw experience text into a single Item or a Subsection's raw_text field, or not creating detailed subsections for experience at all. When this StructuredCV is later used to construct the workflow_input, the 'experience' part is extracted in its raw, unsegmented, and monolithic form.
4.3. Verification of EnhancedContentWriterAgent's Expected Input
The internal methods of EnhancedContentWriterAgent, such as _format_workflow_role and _format_single_role, clearly expect dictionary inputs representing structured roles.1 The presence of _parse_cv_text_to_content_item suggests a fallback mechanism for string inputs, but its primary design favors structured data. The occurrence of the AttributeError demonstrates that this fallback is insufficient for the type of string input being received (i.e., the entire CV text).
4.4. Data Structure Discrepancy Summary
The core issue is a mismatch between the data structure provided to EnhancedContentWriterAgent for experience items and the structure it internally expects for processing.
               * Table 1: Data Structure Discrepancy Analysis
Aspect
	Expected by EnhancedContentWriter (for roles list elements)
	Observed in EnhancedContentWriter's Input Log (roles list)
	Likely Source of Discrepancy

	5. Proposed Fix Plan and Code Modifications
Two primary options exist to resolve this AttributeError: modifying the upstream data provider (Parser/Orchestrator) or adapting the EnhancedContentWriterAgent to handle the current input.
5.1. Option A: Parser/Orchestrator Fix (Preferred)
Rationale:
This approach addresses the root cause by ensuring that data is correctly structured at the earliest possible stage—during parsing. Fixing the data at its source benefits the entire system, not just the EnhancedContentWriterAgent, by promoting data integrity and modularity. It aligns with the design principle of having a "smart parser" that provides well-structured data to simpler, more specialized subsequent agents.
Specific Code Modifications:
               1. File: src/agents/parser_agent.py 1
               2. Method(s): ParserAgent.parse_cv_text and its helper methods (e.g., _parse_cv_with_llm, _parse_cv_with_rules, and the logic that populates the StructuredCV object).
               3. Change Details:
               * The logic within ParserAgent responsible for identifying and extracting the "Professional Experience" section from raw CV text must be significantly enhanced.
               * Instead of treating the entire experience block as a single textual unit, it must be segmented into individual roles.
               * Each identified role should be parsed into a structured dictionary. This dictionary should contain keys such as title, company, dates (or duration), and description or responsibilities (ideally as a list of strings for bullet points).
               * This list of structured role dictionaries should then be used to correctly populate the experience field within the StructuredCV object that the ParserAgent returns. Specifically, within the StructuredCV instance, the "Professional Experience" Section object should have its subsections attribute populated with a list of Subsection objects. Each Subsection will represent an individual role, storing the role's title in name, company/dates in metadata, and bullet points as Item objects in its items list.
               * The data structure that ultimately forms workflow_input['experience'] (which becomes content_item['data']['roles'] for the EnhancedContentWriterAgent) should be a list of these structured role dictionaries. For example:
Python
    },
   #... other parsed roles
]

                  4. File: src/orchestration/workflow_definitions.py 1
                  5. Method: WorkflowBuilder._adapt_for_content_writer
                  6. Change Details: This method should require minimal to no changes if the ParserAgent provides correctly structured experience data. The critical aspect is that experience = input_data.get("experience",) within this adapter should now naturally receive a list of structured role dictionaries due to the ParserAgent's improved output. The adapter correctly passes this experience list to content_item['data']['roles'].
                  * Table 2: Proposed Code Modifications (Option A - Parser Fix)
File Path
	Class/Method Name
	Approximate Line(s) or Logic Area
	Description of Change
	Rationale
	src/agents/parser_agent.py
	ParserAgent.parse_cv_text (and helpers like _parse_cv_with_llm, _parse_cv_with_rules; and how StructuredCV is populated)
	Logic processing the "experience" section of a CV.
	Enhance CV parsing to identify and separate individual professional experience entries. Convert each entry into a structured dictionary (with title, company, duration, responsibilities/description_items (list of strings)) or a Subsection object within StructuredCV. The list of these structured roles should populate the relevant field in ParserAgent's output (e.g., within StructuredCV.sections[experience_section_index].subsections).
	Corrects data structure at origin, ensuring downstream components receive itemized experience data. Promotes cleaner interfaces and data integrity.
	5.2. Option B: ContentWriterAgent Adaptation (Contingency)
Rationale:
This option should only be considered if modifying the upstream ParserAgent is unfeasible in the short term, or if there's an explicit design decision for the EnhancedContentWriterAgent to handle monolithic blocks of experience text. This approach, however, increases the complexity of the EnhancedContentWriterAgent, making it less specialized and potentially duplicating parsing logic.
Specific Code Modifications:
                  1. File: src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py 1
                  2. Method(s): _format_role_info and a new helper method, e.g., _parse_full_cv_experience_string_into_roles.
                  3. Change Details:
                  * When isinstance(role, str) is true within _format_role_info (and role is the entire CV string), the current call to self._parse_cv_text_to_content_item(role, generation_context) is insufficient.
                  * A new, more robust parsing method, for example, _parse_full_cv_experience_string_into_roles(full_cv_string: str, generation_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> List], would need to be implemented. This method would employ advanced parsing techniques (e.g., sophisticated regular expressions, heuristics, or even a dedicated LLM call focused on segmentation) to identify all distinct experience entries within the full_cv_string and return them as a list of structured dictionaries.
                  * The _format_role_info method would then iterate over this list of dictionaries returned by the new parsing helper, calling _format_single_role (or _format_workflow_role) for each.
Python
# Illustrative change within _format_role_info
# when isinstance(role, str) and 'role' is the full CV text:
# actual_parsed_roles = self._parse_full_cv_experience_string_into_roles(role, generation_context)
# for parsed_role_dict in actual_parsed_roles:
#     role_block = self._format_single_role(parsed_role_dict, generation_context)
#     formatted_roles.append(role_block)

This modification effectively embeds a significant parsing capability within the EnhancedContentWriterAgent, which is generally not ideal for maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
5.3. Recommended Approach and Justification
Option A (Parser/Orchestrator Fix) is strongly recommended.
This approach aligns with best practices for software architecture by addressing the data structuring issue at its source. It ensures that the ParserAgent fulfills its responsibility of providing well-structured data to the rest of the system. This leads to:
                     * Improved Modularity: Agents remain specialized. EnhancedContentWriterAgent focuses on content generation, not complex parsing of entire CVs.
                     * Data Integrity: Correctly structured data flows through the system, reducing the likelihood of similar errors in other components.
                     * Maintainability: Easier to debug and maintain individual agents when their responsibilities are clearly defined.
                     * Efficiency: Avoids redundant parsing attempts in downstream agents.
6. Impact Assessment and Data Model Verification
6.1. Impact on Other Content Types (for Option A)
If the modifications to the ParserAgent are carefully scoped to the processing of the "Professional Experience" section, the impact on other content types (such as summary, skills, projects, education) should be minimal. The parsing logic for these other sections would remain unchanged. However, thorough regression testing will be necessary to confirm that no unintended side effects are introduced to the parsing of other CV components.
6.2. Data Model Verification (StructuredCV, Section, Subsection, Item)
The existing data models in src/models/data_models.py 1 appear generally suitable for representing structured CV information, including itemized experience.
                     * StructuredCV: This top-level class holds a list of Section objects, which is appropriate.
                     * Section: A Section object for "Professional Experience" (e.g., name="Professional Experience", content_type="DYNAMIC") should primarily utilize its subsections: List attribute. Each Subsection instance will represent an individual role.
                     * Subsection: Each Subsection representing a role should store:
                     * name: The job title (e.g., "ETUDIANTE EN M2 OPTION GNIE DES SYSTMES INDUSTRIELS").
                     * metadata: A dictionary for company name, dates, location (e.g., {"company": "University X", "duration": "2022-Present"}).
                     * items: List[Item]: A list of Item objects, where each item represents a bullet point or a descriptive line associated with that role.
                     * Item: Each Item within a role's Subsection will typically have item_type=ItemType.BULLET_POINT and its content field will hold the text of the bullet point.
                     * ExperienceEntry Data Model: The current ExperienceEntry(text: str) model is too simplistic if it's intended to represent a fully structured role. If the ParserAgent were to produce a List[ExperienceEntry], then ExperienceEntry itself would need to be redefined as a Pydantic model or TypedDict with fields like title: str, company: str, responsibilities: List[str], etc. However, leveraging the Section/Subsection/Item hierarchy within StructuredCV is more consistent with the overall data modeling approach observed in the codebase.
The fix implemented in the ParserAgent must ensure that it populates the StructuredCV object in alignment with this hierarchical structure. The data passed to the EnhancedContentWriterAgent's roles list should then be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is a serializable representation of one such Subsection (or a custom dictionary structure derived from it, containing all necessary role details). This consistency between parsing, internal data representation (in StructuredCV), and consumption by subsequent agents (EnhancedContentWriter) is paramount for a robust system.
7. Step-by-Step Resolution and Verification Guide
The following steps outline the process to implement the preferred fix (Option A) and verify its effectiveness:
                     1. Step 1: Detailed Logging in EnhancedContentWriterAgent (Diagnostic)
                     * File: src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py
                     * Method: _format_role_info
                     * Action: Before any .get() or dictionary-like access is attempted on the role variable (when it's a string being passed to _parse_cv_text_to_content_item) or on parsed_content, add detailed logging statements.
Python
# Inside _format_role_info, when isinstance(role, str):
logger.debug(f"Attempting to parse role (string). Type: {type(role)}, Value (first 200 chars): {str(role)[:200]}")
parsed_content = self._parse_cv_text_to_content_item(role, generation_context)
logger.debug(f"Result from _parse_cv_text_to_content_item. Type: {type(parsed_content)}, Value (first 200 chars): {str(parsed_content)[:200]}")

# Inside _format_single_role, at the beginning:
logger.debug(f"_format_single_role received role_data. Type: {type(role_data)}, Value (first 200 chars): {str(role_data)[:200]}")

                     * Purpose: To confirm the exact type and value of the variable causing the AttributeError at the point of failure. This helps verify if _parse_cv_text_to_content_item returns a string when it should ideally return a structured dictionary, or if _format_single_role is indeed receiving a string.
                        2. Step 2: Enhance ParserAgent (Primary Fix)
                        * File: src/agents/parser_agent.py
                        * Method(s): ParserAgent.parse_cv_text and its helper methods (e.g., _parse_cv_with_llm, _parse_cv_with_rules).
                        * Action:
                        * Modify the logic that processes the "Professional Experience" section of a raw CV.
                        * Implement mechanisms (using regex, LLM-based segmentation, or heuristic rules) to identify and delineate individual experience entries/roles within the experience block.
                        * For each identified role, parse out details such as job title, company, dates/duration, and a list of responsibilities/achievements (bullet points).
                        * Populate the StructuredCV object correctly:
                        * Create a Section object for "Professional Experience".
                        * For each parsed role, create a Subsection object. The role's title should be the Subsection.name. Company, dates, etc., should go into Subsection.metadata. Each responsibility/achievement bullet point should become an Item object (with item_type=ItemType.BULLET_POINT) within the Subsection.items list.
                        * Ensure the ParserAgent's output (specifically the part representing experience that will feed into workflow_input['experience']) is a list of these structured roles (e.g., a list of dictionaries derived from the Subsection objects).
                        3. Step 3: Verify Upstream Data Propagation
                        * File(s): src/core/orchestrator.py (or src/orchestration/agent_orchestrator.py) and src/orchestration/workflow_definitions.py.
                        * Action:
                        * Trace how the output from the enhanced ParserAgent (particularly the structured list of experiences) is passed through the orchestrator.
                        * Confirm that this structured list correctly populates the experience key in the input_data argument of WorkflowBuilder._adapt_for_content_writer.
                        * Ensure that adapted_data['content_item']['data']['roles'] in _adapt_for_content_writer now receives the list of structured role dictionaries.
                        4. Step 4: Unit Testing ParserAgent
                        * Action: Develop new unit tests for ParserAgent.parse_cv_text.
                        * Use sample CV strings, including one similar to the "Nouha KARIM" example structure, as input.
                        * Assert that the output from the parser for the experience section is a list of dictionaries (or equivalent structured objects), with each dictionary/object correctly representing an individual role and its details.
                        5. Step 5: Integration Testing
                        * Action: Run the complete CV generation workflow using a CV input known to cause the error (e.g., the "Nouha KARIM" CV structure).
                        * Verification:
                        * Confirm that the AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get' in EnhancedContentWriterAgent is resolved.
                        * Verify that the "experience" section is now processed correctly, and tailored content is generated for each distinct role identified by the enhanced ParserAgent.
                        * Inspect logs to ensure EnhancedContentWriterAgent (specifically _format_role_info) receives input_data['content_item']['data']['roles'] as a list of dictionaries.
                        6. Step 6: (Contingency - If Opting for Option B) Refactor EnhancedContentWriterAgent
                        * File: src/agents/enhanced_content_writer.py
                        * Action: If Option A is not pursued, modify _format_role_info.
                        * Implement or significantly enhance _parse_cv_text_to_content_item to become a more powerful parser (e.g., _parse_full_cv_experience_string_into_roles). This new method must take the entire CV string (when role is a string) and return a List] where each dictionary represents a parsed role.
                        * Modify the loop in _format_role_info to iterate over this list of dictionaries when the input role was a single large string.
                        7. Step 7: Code Review and Regression Testing
                        * Action: Conduct a thorough code review of all changes made.
                        * Perform comprehensive regression testing to ensure that the fix does not negatively impact the processing of other CV sections, other content types, or CVs with different structures.
8. Conclusion and Recommendations
The AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get' within the EnhancedContentWriterAgent is a direct consequence of a data structure misalignment. The agent expects a list of structured dictionaries for experience roles but receives a list containing a single string encompassing the entire raw CV text. This issue originates upstream, primarily due to the ParserAgent's current inability to properly segment and structure individual experience entries from the input CV.
Recommendations:
                        1. Prioritize Parser Enhancement (Option A): The most robust and architecturally sound solution is to enhance the ParserAgent (src/agents/parser_agent.py). This agent should be modified to accurately identify, segment, and structure individual professional experience entries from the raw CV text. Each role should be represented as a dictionary (or a corresponding Subsection within the StructuredCV model) containing fields like title, company, duration, and a list of responsibilities/achievements. This ensures that data is correctly structured at its source.
                        2. Verify Data Flow: After enhancing the ParserAgent, meticulously verify that this structured list of experiences correctly propagates through the orchestration layer and into the EnhancedContentWriterAgent via the WorkflowBuilder._adapt_for_content_writer method.
                        3. Comprehensive Testing: Implement thorough unit tests for the ParserAgent focusing on experience parsing. Conduct integration tests with various CV structures to ensure the fix is effective and does not introduce regressions.
                        4. Avoid EnhancedContentWriterAgent Adaptation (Option B) if Possible: While adapting the EnhancedContentWriterAgent to parse the monolithic experience string is a possible workaround, it is not recommended as a primary solution. This would conflate responsibilities, making the EnhancedContentWriterAgent overly complex and less maintainable.
By implementing the recommended changes to the ParserAgent, the system will achieve greater data integrity, improved agent modularity, and reliable generation of tailored "experience" sections in CVs.
