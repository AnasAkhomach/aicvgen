# **AI CV Generator: Technical Debt and Architectural Audit**

## **Executive Summary**

This report presents an exhaustive technical debt audit and architectural analysis of the aicvgen codebase. The aicvgen project is a sophisticated, feature-rich application designed to automate the generation of tailored CVs. Externally, the project exhibits many signs of a modern, well-architected system, including a comprehensive containerization strategy using Docker and Docker Compose, a robust testing suite covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios, and advanced, albeit complex, infrastructure for performance optimization and observability.1 However, this strong external posture is undermined by significant internal technical debt that poses an immediate and critical threat to the application's stability and long-term viability.

The core findings of this audit reveal a fundamental dichotomy: a mature and well-considered approach to deployment and testing coexists with a fragile and inconsistent internal architecture. The most pressing issues are not minor code style violations but systemic problems that guarantee runtime failures, impede maintainability, and compromise the integrity of the application's data flow. The primary risks to the project can be categorized into two main areas. The first is an immediate and critical threat to application stability. Runtime logs and static analysis reports show a collection of high-severity bugs, including a TypeError related to awaiting a NoneType object and multiple Pylint-flagged no-member and import-error issues, which prevent the application from starting or cause it to crash during key workflow operations.1 The second major risk is architectural in nature, stemming from a high degree of coupling and broken data contracts between the system's autonomous agents. This leads to an unpredictable and brittle workflow, manifesting as

NoneType errors and data loss during execution, as evidenced by application logs.1

The strategic recommendation of this audit is twofold. The immediate priority must be a stabilization phase focused on resolving all startup and runtime crashers. This will make the application functional and provide a stable baseline for further work. Following stabilization, a strategic refactoring effort is required to address the deeper architectural issues. This effort should focus on enforcing the architectural patterns the system was clearly designed for—namely, clear orchestrator-led communication between agents and the enforcement of consistent, reliable data contracts. Addressing these foundational issues is essential to realizing the project's potential and ensuring its long-term viability and maintainability.

## **Architectural Health and Structural Integrity**

A review of the high-level design of the aicvgen application reveals a sophisticated but flawed architecture. While the intent is a modular, agent-based system orchestrated by a central workflow graph, several deviations from this pattern have introduced significant structural weaknesses. These issues compromise the system's maintainability, debuggability, and overall architectural integrity.

### **The "Sub-Orchestrator" Anti-Pattern**

The primary architectural pattern is intended to be a state-driven workflow managed by a LangGraph orchestrator, as defined in src/orchestration/cv\_workflow\_graph.py.1 In this design, the graph explicitly defines the sequence of operations (e.g., Parse \-\> Research \-\> Write \-\> QA), ensuring that each step is a distinct, observable, and manageable node.1 However, a significant architectural drift has occurred with the implementation of the

ContentOptimizationAgent. The ContentOptimizationAgent in src/agents/specialized\_agents.py directly instantiates and manages its own pool of EnhancedContentWriterAgent instances.1 This behavior constitutes a "sub-orchestrator" anti-pattern.1

The main LangGraph orchestrator invokes the ContentOptimizationAgent as a single, opaque node. Within this node, however, a hidden, secondary workflow is executed where the agent iterates through various content types and calls other agents (EnhancedContentWriterAgent) to perform the actual writing tasks. This internal orchestration bypasses the primary control and observability mechanisms of the main workflow graph.1 The sequence of events unfolds as follows:

1. The main orchestrator, following the logic in cv\_workflow\_graph.py, reaches a node that is responsible for content generation.  
2. Instead of calling a simple content\_writer\_node for a specific piece of content, it delegates the entire optimization task to the ContentOptimizationAgent.  
3. The ContentOptimizationAgent then internally loops through different content types and, for each one, creates and calls an instance of EnhancedContentWriterAgent.  
4. The main orchestrator remains unaware of these granular sub-steps. Its logs and state transitions will only show a single, monolithic "Optimize Content" step.

The primary consequence of this architectural drift is a severe degradation in debuggability and control. If a specific content-writing task fails (e.g., for the "Executive Summary"), the error will originate from deep within the ContentOptimizationAgent, not from a clearly defined and isolated node in the main graph. This makes it exceedingly difficult to trace the root cause of the failure. This hidden complexity has a tangible impact on performance tuning and resilience. For instance, if the LLM service experiences latency, the system's performance monitor will only report that the ContentOptimizationAgent node is slow. It will be unable to pinpoint which of the multiple, hidden content generation calls is the actual bottleneck, turning any performance optimization effort into a process of guesswork.

Furthermore, the main orchestrator cannot apply its own cross-cutting concerns—such as error handling, retry logic, or parallelization—to the individual content-writing tasks, as they are hidden within this black-box agent. This design choice fundamentally undermines the purpose of using a state-driven graph orchestrator, which is to make complex workflows explicit, manageable, and resilient.1 The existence of this pattern suggests that it may have been implemented as an expedient solution to encapsulate a complex loop, possibly due to a lack of familiarity with LangGraph's more advanced capabilities for managing iterative or conditional flows. This points to a potential skills gap or a prioritization of feature velocity over architectural integrity.

### **Evaluation of State Management Complexity**

The aicvgen project suffers from a convoluted and fragmented approach to state management, which introduces significant architectural complexity and a high risk of data synchronization bugs. The application's state is managed across at least three distinct and loosely coupled layers 1:

1. **Frontend State (src/frontend/state\_helpers.py):** This layer is responsible for managing the Streamlit st.session\_state. It holds raw user inputs from UI components (like text areas and checkboxes) and tracks the UI's processing status.  
2. **Workflow State (src/orchestration/state.py):** This layer defines the AgentState Pydantic model. This object is intended to be the canonical "source of truth" during a single, end-to-end execution of the LangGraph workflow. It aggregates all data required by the agents, including the structured CV, job description, research findings, and control flags.  
3. **Persistence State (src/core/state\_manager.py):** This layer consists of the StateManager class, which is responsible for the low-level persistence of key data structures, such as StructuredCV and JobDescriptionData, to the filesystem as JSON or pickle files.

The flow of data through these layers is unnecessarily complex, creating a fragile chain of data-copying operations. A user's input begins in the UI, is captured into st.session\_state, then copied into an AgentState object by the create\_agent\_state\_from\_ui function to initiate the backend workflow. As the workflow progresses, the AgentState is mutated by various agents. Concurrently, the StateManager may be called upon to persist portions of this state to disk. Each step in this chain represents a potential point of failure or data transformation error. A bug in create\_agent\_state\_from\_ui, for example, could initiate the entire backend workflow with incorrect data, even if the UI state itself is valid.

This multi-layered approach creates critical ambiguity, particularly in failure scenarios. If an error occurs midway through the workflow, it is not clear which layer represents the true state of the application. Is it the original user input still held in st.session\_state? Is it the last valid AgentState before the failure? Or is it the last version of the structured\_cv.json file saved to disk by the StateManager? This ambiguity makes robust error recovery and state restoration exceptionally challenging for developers to implement correctly. It also increases the cognitive overhead for new developers, who must trace data across multiple, disconnected modules to understand the application's behavior. This over-engineering of state management, without a clear single source of truth, is a significant architectural smell that suggests an evolutionary design where layers were added reactively, leading to a system that is inherently difficult to reason about and prone to synchronization bugs.

### **Service Layer Cohesion and Responsibility Overlap**

An analysis of the src/services/ directory reveals a lack of clear boundaries and a duplication of responsibilities, particularly concerning retry logic and rate limiting.1 This overlap violates the Single Responsibility Principle and can lead to unpredictable system behavior, especially under failure conditions. The primary components involved are

llm\_service.py, item\_processor.py, and rate\_limiter.py.

* The EnhancedLLMService in llm\_service.py implements its own retry logic using the tenacity library and integrates with a RetryableRateLimiter.  
* The ItemProcessor in item\_processor.py is responsible for processing individual CV items and *also* implements its own retry and rate-limiting logic.

This duplication creates a scenario where multiple, independent retry mechanisms can be triggered by a single underlying failure. For instance, if an agent calls the ItemProcessor, which in turn calls the EnhancedLLMService, a failure in the LLM API call could trigger the retry logic in llm\_service.py. If that service ultimately fails after its retries, the failure propagates back to the ItemProcessor, which may then initiate its *own* set of retries. This layered retry approach can lead to several negative consequences:

* **Excessive Delays:** The total wait time for a user becomes the product of multiple, nested retry policies, leading to a poor user experience. The system's behavior under failure becomes unpredictable, as the total delay is a function of independent policies, making it difficult to debug or tune.  
* **Thundering Herd Problem:** If multiple components are retrying independently, they can overwhelm a rate-limited external API as soon as it becomes available. Each component, unaware of the others, will send a request simultaneously, causing the API to become rate-limited again immediately. This is a classic anti-pattern in distributed systems.

To ensure predictable and efficient error handling, all logic related to retries, caching, and rate limiting for a specific external service (such as the LLM API) must be centralized. The responsibility for managing all aspects of the interaction with the LLM API should reside solely within the EnhancedLLMService. Other services, like the ItemProcessor, should not re-implement these concerns but should instead rely on the resilience mechanisms provided by the EnhancedLLMService. This lack of clear ownership for cross-cutting concerns suggests that different developers likely implemented resilience where they saw fit, without a guiding architectural principle for service design, pointing to a need for stronger governance.

## **Internal API and Data Contract Analysis**

The contracts between the system's internal components, particularly between the LangGraph orchestrator and its agents, are poorly defined and frequently violated. This leads to a brittle workflow where data is unexpectedly lost or malformed during transitions between nodes, resulting in the runtime errors observed in the application logs.1

### **Systematic AgentIO Contract Breaches**

The AgentIO schema, defined in src/models/data\_models.py, is intended to serve as a formal API contract for each agent, specifying its expected inputs and outputs.1 However, a direct comparison of these schemas with the actual implementation in

src/orchestration/cv\_workflow\_graph.py reveals that these contracts have been systematically ignored or have drifted significantly from the implementation.1 The

AgentIO schemas now function more as misleading documentation than as enforceable contracts.

The run\_as\_node method of each agent is the primary interface used by the LangGraph orchestrator. This method is expected to return a dictionary containing keys that correspond to fields in the AgentState object, which the graph then uses to update its state. The contract breaches occur when the keys in this returned dictionary do not match what is promised in the agent's output\_schema.1 The following table details the most significant contract breaches identified. This consolidated evidence log transforms abstract concerns about "brittle code" into a concrete, itemized list of architectural defects, providing a clear basis for justifying and planning a refactoring effort.

| Issue ID | Agent | AgentIO Output Schema (Promised) | run\_as\_node Output (Actual) | Breach Analysis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CB-01 | ParserAgent | {"required\_fields": \["parsed\_data"\]} | {"structured\_cv":..., "job\_description\_data":...} | **CONTRACT\_BREACH:** The agent's formal contract promises a generic parsed\_data object. In reality, its node implementation returns two specific, top-level AgentState fields: structured\_cv and job\_description\_data.1 |
| CB-02 | EnhancedContentWriterAgent | {"required\_fields": \["content", "metadata", "quality\_metrics"\]} | {"structured\_cv":..., "error\_messages":...} | **CONTRACT\_BREACH:** The contract promises a discrete content block for a single item. The implementation, however, modifies and returns the entire structured\_cv object, completely bypassing the defined output structure.1 |
| CB-03 | ResearchAgent | {"required\_fields": \["research\_results", "content\_matches"\]} | {"research\_findings":...} | **NAMING\_INCONSISTENCY & MISSING DATA:** The agent returns data under the key research\_findings instead of research\_results. Additionally, it fails to return the promised content\_matches data.1 |
| CB-04 | QualityAssuranceAgent | {"output": {"quality\_check\_results":...}} | {"cv\_analysis\_results":...} | **NAMING\_INCONSISTENCY:** The agent returns data under the key cv\_analysis\_results instead of the promised quality\_check\_results, preventing the data from being correctly merged into the AgentState.1 |
| CB-05 | FormatterAgent | {"required\_fields": \["formatted\_cv", "output\_path"\]} | {"final\_output\_path":...} | **MISSING DATA:** The agent's node returns the final\_output\_path but fails to return the formatted\_cv content, which is explicitly required by its contract.1 |

### **Impact Analysis: The Causal Chain from Contract Breach to Runtime Failure**

The contract breaches detailed above are not merely academic concerns; they are the direct root cause of the runtime failures observed in the application logs.1 The

NoneType errors and data-not-found exceptions are the predictable result of a workflow that is losing data in transit between nodes due to these broken contracts. The runtime crashes are not random bugs but are the deterministic outcome of this flawed architecture. The system is failing precisely because its components are not communicating as designed.

A clear causal chain can be established:

1. An agent node, such as the qa\_node, is executed. Its underlying QualityAssuranceAgent is contractually obligated by its AgentIO schema to return a dictionary containing the key quality\_check\_results.1  
2. Due to the naming inconsistency identified in issue CB-04, the qa\_node actually returns a dictionary with the key cv\_analysis\_results.  
3. The LangGraph orchestrator receives this dictionary and attempts to merge it into the main AgentState. It updates a field named cv\_analysis\_results but leaves the expected quality\_check\_results field unmodified, which remains None (its default value from the AgentState Pydantic model).  
4. A subsequent node in the workflow, such as a conditional router or the final formatter, is designed to operate on the state.quality\_check\_results field.  
5. When this subsequent node attempts to access the data (e.g., state.quality\_check\_results.get('overall\_score')), it is performing a method call on a None object.  
6. This triggers a fatal AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get', causing the entire workflow to crash. A similar TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression is observed in the error log, which is a variation of the same root cause: an operation is attempted on a None object within an async context.1

This analysis demonstrates that the application's runtime fragility is a direct consequence of these internal API contract violations. The await keyword in the error log is likely a red herring; the true error is the NoneType object being passed into an async function that expects an object. The await is simply the point at which program execution halts when the TypeError is raised. This understanding fundamentally changes the remediation strategy. The fix is not to litter the code with tactical if obj is not None: checks, but to implement a strategic fix: enforce the data contracts to ensure that None values are never passed where an object is expected.

## **Code-Level Quality and Maintainability Audit**

Beyond the high-level architectural issues, a detailed review of the source code reveals significant technical debt at the implementation level. These issues include code duplication, overly complex functions, and critical errors flagged by static analysis, all of which contribute to a higher maintenance burden and an increased likelihood of defects.

### **Code Duplication: The Underutilized Base Class**

A recurring issue across the agent implementations is the failure to consistently use centralized utility methods provided by the EnhancedAgentBase class. This has led to significant code duplication, particularly in the logic for parsing JSON from LLM responses.1 The

EnhancedAgentBase provides a robust utility method, \_generate\_and\_parse\_json, which is designed to handle the common pattern of sending a prompt to the LLM, receiving a response, and safely extracting a JSON object from the raw text, even when it is embedded in markdown code blocks or other conversational text.1

Despite the existence of this centralized utility, multiple agents reimplement this logic manually and inconsistently 1:

* **ParserAgent:** In methods like parse\_job\_description and \_parse\_experience\_section\_with\_llm, the agent uses manual string manipulation (response.find('{'), response.rfind('}')) to locate and extract JSON.  
* **EnhancedContentWriterAgent:** The \_generate\_content\_with\_llm method uses its own \_extract\_json\_from\_response helper, which duplicates the regex-based cleaning logic found in the base class.  
* **ResearchAgent:** The \_analyze\_job\_requirements and \_research\_company\_info methods also use manual string finding to extract JSON.

This widespread duplication has several negative consequences. It increases the overall code volume and complexity, making the system harder to understand and maintain. More importantly, it creates a significant maintenance risk. If a new edge case in LLM response formatting is discovered (e.g., a new style of markdown block), the fix must be identified and applied in multiple different places across the codebase, increasing the likelihood that one or more instances will be missed, leading to inconsistent behavior and bugs. This pattern is often a symptom of "copy-paste" development, where developers may be unaware of shared utilities or prioritize short-term implementation speed over long-term maintainability, pointing to a need for more rigorous code review and a stronger culture of leveraging shared components.

### **Code Smells: Overly Complex Functions**

Several modules exhibit code smells related to function complexity, but the most prominent example is the parse\_cv\_text method within src/agents/parser\_agent.py.1 This function is a classic example of the "Long Method" code smell. It spans a large number of lines and is responsible for a wide range of parsing tasks, including:

* Extracting contact information (name, email, phone, etc.).  
* Identifying top-level section headers using regex.  
* Identifying subsection headers.  
* Parsing bullet-point items.  
* Handling special cases for the "Key Qualifications" and "Executive Summary" sections.  
* Invoking an asynchronous LLM-based enhancement for certain sections.

This consolidation of multiple responsibilities into a single function makes the code difficult to read, test, and safely modify. A bug in one part of the logic, such as the regex for contact information, could have unintended side effects on the parsing of subsequent sections. The function's high cyclomatic complexity (a measure of the number of independent paths through the code) makes it inherently more difficult to achieve high test coverage and increases the probability of hidden bugs.1 This type of technical debt acts as a direct barrier to agility. A developer tasked with improving just one part of the CV parsing (e.g., phone number extraction) must first understand this entire, massive function to make a change safely. This slows down development velocity and increases the risk of introducing regressions, meaning the debt accrues "interest" in the form of longer development cycles and increased bug-fixing time. Refactoring this monolithic function into a set of smaller, single-responsibility helper methods (e.g.,

\_parse\_contact\_info, \_parse\_section\_header, \_parse\_bullet\_item, \_enhance\_section\_with\_llm) would significantly improve its clarity and maintainability.

### **Static Analysis Report: High-Severity Pylint Errors**

The Pylint static analysis reports provide clear, objective evidence of critical code quality issues.1 These are not stylistic preferences but are direct indicators of code that is guaranteed to fail at runtime. The persistence of these high-severity errors in the codebase suggests a potential gap in the development and quality assurance process. In a mature CI/CD pipeline, such errors should fail the build, preventing them from being merged. Their presence indicates that either the static analysis step is being ignored or that code is being committed without being fully tested.

The most critical Pylint errors identified are 1:

* **E0401: import-error:** Found in src/agents/specialized\_agents.py, this error indicates an inability to import aicvgen.src.exceptions.agent\_exceptions. This is a fatal error that will prevent the module from loading, causing the application to crash at startup.  
* **E1101: no-member:** This error appears repeatedly, for example in src/agents/formatter\_agent.py. The code attempts to access members like error\_message on a dict instance, which will result in a fatal AttributeError during execution, crashing the formatting workflow.  
* **E1121: too-many-function-args:** Found in src/agents/enhanced\_content\_writer.py, this error indicates a static method is being called with too many positional arguments. This will result in a fatal TypeError at runtime.

## **Deprecated Logic and Redundant Code**

The codebase contains several modules and scripts that appear to be obsolete or redundant. This dead code adds unnecessary cognitive load for developers, increases the maintenance surface area, and creates confusion about the application's intended architecture and functionality.

### **Identification of Dead Code: The fix\_\*.py Scripts**

The root directory of the project contains three utility scripts: fix\_agents\_imports.py, fix\_all\_imports.py, and fix\_imports.py.1 An analysis of these files reveals that their purpose is to programmatically find and replace Python import statements throughout the

src/ directory. These scripts function as archaeological artifacts of past development challenges. Their existence strongly suggests that the project's module structure was at one point unstable or that developers struggled with setting up their local environments correctly, leading to inconsistent import paths.1

Such scripts are typically created as one-time fixes during a major refactoring. Now that the application's structure appears to have stabilized, these scripts serve no ongoing purpose in the build, test, or deployment process. They are dead code. While harmless if left untouched, they add clutter to the repository and can be a source of confusion for new developers, who might mistakenly believe they are a required part of the development workflow. Their existence is a data point suggesting a development history that may have been reactive rather than planned. Their removal would clean up the project root and eliminate this potential for confusion.

### **Redundant Frontend Implementation: Streamlit vs. Traditional Web**

A significant architectural inconsistency exists within the frontend implementation. The codebase contains two distinct and conflicting frontend architectures 1:

1. **A Streamlit-based Frontend:** This is the primary, functional frontend for the application. The entry point app.py is a Streamlit application, and the UI is built programmatically using components from src/frontend/ui\_components.py and callbacks.py.  
2. **A Traditional Web Frontend:** The repository also contains files for a traditional, non-Streamlit web application, including src/frontend/templates/index.html and src/frontend/static/js/script.js. The JavaScript in script.js is written to make direct API calls to endpoints like /api/cv/parse and /api/session/load, implying the existence of a standard REST API backend (likely using a framework like FastAPI).

This is a major structural issue. The presence of two separate frontend implementations suggests that the traditional HTML/JS frontend is likely a remnant of an earlier prototype or a parallel development effort that was later abandoned in favor of Streamlit, perhaps to accelerate prototyping and iteration.1 As the main application is now clearly based on Streamlit, this entire set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the traditional frontend constitutes deprecated and redundant logic.

This dead code significantly inflates the size and complexity of the codebase. It creates confusion about the project's true architecture and forces developers to spend time understanding code that is no longer in use. A thorough audit should be conducted to confirm that the traditional web frontend is indeed unused, after which it should be completely removed from the repository to simplify the architecture and reduce maintenance overhead.

## **Consolidated Findings and Strategic Remediation Plan**

This audit has identified significant technical debt across the aicvgen codebase, ranging from critical runtime errors to deep-seated architectural inconsistencies. To address these findings in a structured manner, this section provides a consolidated list of issues and a strategic, phased remediation plan designed to first stabilize the application and then improve its long-term health and maintainability.

### **Technical Debt Prioritization Matrix**

The following table categorizes and prioritizes the identified technical debt items. Issues are grouped by priority, from P1 (critical crashers) to P3 (architectural and maintainability improvements). Each item is assigned a unique ID, a category tag, a description, and a high-level remediation plan with an estimated effort level. This matrix is designed to be a direct input for sprint planning and resource allocation.

| Issue ID | Category Tag | Description | Location(s) | Problem Analysis & Impact | Suggested Remediation | Effort (L/M/H) |

| CB-01 | CONTRACT\_BREACH | Agent output schema mismatches | src/agents/, src/orchestration/cv\_workflow\_graph.py | Agents' run\_as\_node methods return dictionaries with keys that do not match their AgentIO output schemas. This breaks the data contract, causing data loss in the AgentState and leading to downstream NoneType errors.1 | For each agent, refactor its run\_as\_node method to return a dictionary with keys that exactly match the fields in AgentState. Update the AgentIO schemas to accurately reflect these outputs. | High |
| CB-02 | NAMING\_INCONSISTENCY | Inconsistent naming for agent output keys | src/agents/quality\_assurance\_agent.py, src/agents/research\_agent.py | Naming mismatches (e.g., cv\_analysis\_results vs. quality\_check\_results) cause data to be written to the wrong field in AgentState, making it unavailable to subsequent nodes.1 | Standardize all keys returned by run\_as\_node methods to be consistent with the AgentState Pydantic model and the AgentIO schemas. | Low |

### **Strategic Remediation Roadmap**

A phased approach is recommended to tackle the identified technical debt. This roadmap prioritizes stability first, followed by correctness and long-term architectural health.

#### **Phase 1: Stabilization (Immediate Priority)**

* **Goal:** Make the application reliably start and execute a basic workflow without crashing.  
* **Actions:**  
  1. **Fix Critical Pylint Errors:** Address all P1 "Critical Crasher" issues from the matrix (ERR-02, ERR-03). This involves resolving every import-error, no-member, and other build-breaking error identified by Pylint.1  
  2. **Establish CI Gate:** Configure the Continuous Integration pipeline to fail the build on any high-severity static analysis errors. This prevents new critical defects from being introduced into the codebase.

#### **Phase 2: Contract Enforcement and Data Flow Integrity (High Priority)**

* **Goal:** Ensure data flows correctly and predictably through the LangGraph workflow, eliminating the root cause of the NoneType errors and data loss between nodes.  
* **Actions:**  
  1. **Align Agent Outputs:** Systematically fix all P2 "Contract & Data Flow" issues (CB-01, CB-02). The return dictionary of every run\_as\_node method must be updated to use keys that directly correspond to the fields in the AgentState Pydantic model.1  
  2. **Update AgentIO Schemas:** After aligning the agent outputs, update the AgentIO schemas for each agent to accurately document the inputs they consume from AgentState and the fields they update. This restores the schemas to their intended purpose as reliable contracts.  
  3. **Impact:** This phase is critical for eliminating the NoneType and data-not-found errors observed in the runtime logs, directly addressing the core instability of the application.1

#### **Phase 3: Code and Architectural Refactoring (Medium Priority)**

* **Goal:** Improve the long-term maintainability, readability, and architectural consistency of the codebase by paying down accumulated debt.  
* **Actions:**  
  1. **Address Architectural Drift:** Begin the significant refactoring of the ContentOptimizationAgent (AD-01). Decompose its internal logic into explicit nodes within the main cv\_workflow\_graph. This will be a high-effort task but is essential for architectural integrity.1  
  2. **Eliminate Duplication:** Refactor all agents to use the centralized \_generate\_and\_parse\_json utility from the base class, removing all manual JSON parsing logic (DUP-01).1  
  3. **Remove Dead Code:** Delete the obsolete fix\_\*.py scripts and the redundant traditional web frontend files (DL-01, DL-02).1  
  4. **Refactor Code Smells:** Break down large, complex functions like parse\_cv\_text into smaller, more focused, and more easily testable units (SMELL-01).1
