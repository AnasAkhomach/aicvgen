# Comprehensive Testing Suite Plan for CV Tailoring AI Agent
Based on my analysis of the project documentation (SRS, Refactoring Roadmap, MVP updates) and current codebase, I've developed a comprehensive testing strategy that aligns with the multi-agent architecture and MVP requirements.

## Current State Assessment
The project already has a solid foundation with:

- Existing test structure in `tests` with unit and integration directories
- Well-configured pytest setup with `conftest.py` providing comprehensive fixtures
- Partial test coverage for core components like `test_state_manager.py` and `test_content_writer_agent.py`
## Phase 1: Review and Update Existing Tests
### Priority Updates Needed:
1. State Manager Tests - Update to reflect enhanced `StructuredCV` model
2. Content Writer Agent Tests - Align with `EnhancedContentWriterAgent` implementation
3. Agent Base Tests - Update for `EnhancedAgentBase` with async capabilities
## Phase 2: Core Component Unit Tests
### High-Priority Components for Testing: 1. Enhanced Orchestrator ( `orchestrator.py` )
- Test Scenarios:
  - Individual item processing workflow (key MVP requirement)
  - Rate limit handling and queue management
  - Session state persistence and recovery
  - Error recovery and retry logic
  - Progress tracking integration 2. LLM Service ( `llm.py` )
- Test Scenarios:
  - API key fallback mechanism
  - Rate limiting integration
  - Response parsing and error handling
  - Token usage tracking
  - Timeout and retry behavior 3. Rate Limiter ( `rate_limiter.py` )
- Test Scenarios:
  - Request throttling (30 RPM, 6000 TPM limits)
  - Exponential backoff implementation
  - Multi-model rate tracking
  - Async wait mechanisms 4. Individual Agents
- ParserAgent : CV parsing from Markdown, job description extraction
- ContentWriterAgent : "Big 10" skills generation, role-by-role processing
- FormatterAgent : PDF generation, content formatting
- QualityAssuranceAgent : Content validation and scoring
### Mock Strategy:
- External APIs : Mock Groq/Gemini LLM calls with realistic response delays
- File System : Use temporary directories for state persistence testing
- Vector Database : Mock ChromaDB operations for embedding tests
## Phase 3: Integration Tests
### Key Integration Points: 1. Orchestrator ↔ Agents
- Scenario : Complete workflow from job description to generated CV sections
- Focus : Data flow through `StructuredCV` state management
- Assertions : Proper status transitions (INITIAL → GENERATED → ACCEPTED) 2. Agent ↔ Services
- Scenario : ContentWriterAgent using LLMService with rate limiting
- Focus : Error propagation and retry mechanisms
- Assertions : Proper rate limit handling, fallback behavior 3. State Persistence
- Scenario : Session save/restore across workflow interruptions
- Focus : Data integrity and recovery capabilities
- Assertions : Complete state reconstruction from saved sessions
## Phase 4: End-to-End Tests
### Critical User Workflows: E2E Test 1: Complete CV Generation
- Input : Sample job description + base CV (Markdown)
- Process : Full workflow through all agents
- Output : Tailored PDF with "Big 10" skills, experience bullets, projects
- Assertions : PDF structure, content quality, processing time E2E Test 2: Individual Item Processing
- Input : Single professional experience role
- Process : Role-by-role generation (MVP requirement)
- Output : Tailored experience bullets
- Assertions : Rate limit compliance, user feedback integration E2E Test 3: Error Recovery
- Input : Invalid job description or API failures
- Process : Error handling and recovery workflows
- Output : Graceful degradation or retry success
- Assertions : User notification, state preservation
## Test Data Strategy
### Sample Data Sets:
- Job Descriptions : Tech roles (AI Engineer, Data Scientist, Software Developer)
- Base CVs : Various experience levels and formats
- Expected Outputs : Pre-validated CV sections for comparison
### Mock Responses:
- LLM Outputs : Realistic "Big 10" skills, experience bullets
- API Errors : Rate limit, timeout, authentication failures
- Vector Search : Relevant CV content matches
## Implementation Priority
### Week 1: Foundation
1. Update existing test fixtures in `conftest.py`
2. Refactor `test_state_manager.py` for enhanced models
3. Create comprehensive LLM service tests
### Week 2: Core Components
1. Enhanced Orchestrator unit tests
2. Rate Limiter comprehensive testing
3. Individual agent test suites
### Week 3: Integration & E2E
1. Agent interaction tests
2. Complete workflow integration tests
3. End-to-end user scenarios
## Success Metrics
- Coverage Target : 85%+ for core components
- Performance : E2E tests complete within 2 minutes
- Reliability : 95%+ test pass rate in CI/CD
- Maintainability : Clear test documentation and fixtures
## Tools & Framework
- Primary : pytest with async support
- Mocking : unittest.mock for external dependencies
- Coverage : pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Fixtures : Leverage existing `conftest.py` infrastructure
This comprehensive testing strategy ensures robust validation of the MVP's core functionality while supporting the individual item processing approach that mitigates LLM rate limits—a critical architectural requirement identified in the project documentation.
