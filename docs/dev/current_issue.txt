## Current Status Analysis
From the logs in c:\Users\Nitro\Desktop\aicvgen\logs\app.log , I can see:

### ✅ What's Working:
- Parser Agent Integration : The /api/cv/parse endpoint is working successfully (HTTP 200 OK)
- LLM Processing : Job description parsing is completing successfully with Gemini model
- Session Management : State is being saved properly
- Basic API Endpoints : /api/cv/structure and /api/cv/export are responding
### ❌ Current Issues:
1. Result Structure Invalid : The logs show Result structure invalid: success=False at line 236
2. Server Crashes : The server is still exiting with non-zero exit code 5999
3. Workflow Execution : While parsing works, there seem to be issues in the downstream workflow processing
## The Real Problem
The parser agent integration is working correctly - the issue is in the workflow execution and result processing that happens after parsing. The application can successfully:

- Parse job descriptions ✅
- Parse CV text ✅
- Save session state ✅
But it's failing when trying to:

- Process the complete workflow ❌
- Generate the final CV content ❌
- Return valid results to the frontend ❌
## Next Steps Needed
To fully resolve this, we need to:

1. Investigate the workflow execution errors in the result processing
2. Check the content generation pipeline after parsing
3. Debug the result structure validation that's failing
4. Examine the complete CV generation workflow integration
The parser agent fix was successful, but there are deeper workflow integration issues that need to be addressed for the complete CV generation process to work end-to-end.
