## Analysis of CV Generation Issue
After analyzing the logs and session data, I've identified the core problem with the CV generation system:

### Root Cause: Prompt Template Mismatch
The issue is that the LLM is generating instruction acknowledgments ("Okay, I understand...") instead of actual CV content. This indicates a fundamental problem with how the prompt templates are being used:

1. Template Variables Not Populated : The `resume_role_prompt.md` template expects variables like {{Target Skills}} and {{batched_structured_output}} , but these aren't being populated by the `_build_prompt` method.
2. Wrong Template Format : The current prompt building logic uses simple .format() with variables like {job_title} , {job_description} , etc., but the actual template uses different variable names and structure.
3. Missing Data Structure : The template expects structured role information with accomplishments and skills, but the current implementation is passing raw CV text.
### Evidence from Session Data
The generated content in `state.json` shows:

```
• Okay, I understand
• I will generate tailored CV content for each role...
• Each bullet point will start with the skill name in 
bold...
```
This is clearly the LLM responding to instructions rather than generating CV content.

### Immediate Action Required
No, we don't need more testing yet. We need to fix the fundamental prompt template issue first:

1. Fix Template Variable Mapping : Update the _build_prompt method to properly populate the template variables expected by resume_role_prompt.md
2. Restructure Input Data : Ensure the CV data is properly structured with skills, accomplishments, and role information as expected by the template
3. Template Alignment : Either modify the template to match the current data structure or modify the data preparation to match the template expectations
### Next Steps
1. Immediate Fix : Correct the prompt template variable mapping
2. Data Structure Fix : Ensure proper data formatting for the templates
3. Test with Fixed Prompts : Only then proceed with testing
4. Validation : Verify that actual CV content is generated instead of instruction acknowledgments
The system architecture is working correctly - the issue is specifically in the prompt template integration layer
