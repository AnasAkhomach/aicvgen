## Root Cause Analysis
The issue stems from how the workflow adapter structures the experience data for the EnhancedContentWriter . Looking at the logs, I can see that:

1. Data Structure Problem : The content_item contains a data.roles array with a single string element (the entire CV text), but the EnhancedContentWriter expects structured role objects with .get() method access.
2. Specific Error Location : In the _format_role_info method around line 320-340, the code tries to call .get() on what it expects to be a dictionary, but receives a string instead.
3. Data Flow Issue : The workflow adapter in workflow_definitions.py calls _extract_structured_experience() which should convert the StructuredCV into role dictionaries, but the parser is not creating proper subsections for individual roles.
## The Problem Chain
1. Parser Issue : The ParserAgent is not properly segmenting the experience section into individual role subsections
2. Workflow Adapter : Receives unsegmented experience data and passes raw CV text
3. Content Writer : Expects structured role dictionaries but gets CV text strings
4. AttributeError : When trying to call .get() on a string
## Immediate Fix Required
The EnhancedContentWriter needs better error handling for when it receives CV text instead of structured role data. Specifically:

1. Fix the _format_role_info method to handle string inputs gracefully
2. Improve the _parse_cv_text_to_content_item method to better extract role information
3. Add validation in the workflow adapter to ensure proper data structure
## Next Steps
1. Update the EnhancedContentWriter to handle mixed data types (strings and dictionaries) in the roles array
2. Improve the parser to create proper subsections for each role in the experience section
3. Add data validation in the workflow adapter to catch structure mismatches early
The core issue is that while the parser agent fix was implemented, the experience parsing logic still doesn't properly segment individual roles into separate subsections, causing downstream failures in the content writer.
